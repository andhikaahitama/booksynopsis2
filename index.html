<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Wright in Hollywood: Visions of a New Architecture</h2><p><p>The textile-block system was a fascinating experiment that Frank Lloyd Wright conducted from about 1922 to 1932 as part of his quest to find a new system of construction using a standardized building material based on the idea of twentieth-century machine technology. Robert Sweeney has meticulously researched the textile block system, providing a case-by-case account of each project, commenting on Wright's clients, collaborators, and contractors, and positioning Wright's experiment firmly within the larger historical context of concrete block technology. Sweeney traces the forms of several of the early concrete block projects to Wright's own earlier work, clarifies an array of important technical challenges the architect faced, and notes the numerous block shapes required for executionThe concrete block experiment was firmly rooted in the concept of architectural simplification that Wright established at the outset of his career. It was begun in Hollywood, where he was living at the time, but was part of a larger vision with global application. Wright pursued the concept with a sense of mission, designing approximately thirty projects through the decade. Sweeney shows, however that this technical evolution can be explained in just three designs: the canonical Millard house of February 1923; and in two unexecuted projects, the Community Playhouse, "Little Dipper," for Aline Barnsdall, and in designs for a resort hotel for the Arizona desert.Although Wright began with structure, Sweeney points out that he was primarily interested in form: technology of assembly was only a path to architectural creation. As the structural system matured - a process coinciding with the evolution of the minimalist International Style in Europe - the buildings became increasingly architectonic; forms were simplified, and the initial fascination with ornament all but disappeared.Robert L. Sweeney is Executive Director of the R. M. Shindler House in Los Angeles. His comprehensive annotated bibliography on Wright was published in 1978.</p></p><p>Robert L.

The authors cover multiple facets of climate, many of which play a significant role in everyday life&#x2014;and examine many topics, such as past climates, that are seldom adequately covered in other introductions to the subject. The science behind widely publicized events is explained within the systematic coverage of climate and climatology. The relationships between climate and peopleare discussed in detail, and readers are shown how common things ranging from wind-chill to architecture are understood in the wider context of climate. In the Third Edition, data and information have been updated throughout and significant coverage is devoted to climate change.<br> Climatology in the World Today; Energy and the Climate System; Atmospheric Temperatures; Climate and the Hydrologic Cycle; Wind and Circulation Patterns; Atmosphere-Ocean Interactions; Air Mass and Synoptic Climatology; Air Mass and Synoptic Climatology; Climatology of Atmospheric Storms; Natural Causes of Climate Change; Reconstruction of Past Climates; Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming; Climate Change and the Physical Environment; Climate Change and the Living World; Changes in Atmospheric Chemistry; Regional Climates: Scales of Study; Tropical Climates; Mid-Latitude Climates; Polar and Highland Climates; The Human Response to Climate; Climate, Agriculture, and Industry.<br> A useful reference for anyone who wants to learn more about Earth&#x2019;s climate and weather.<br> <br></p><p>This book offers a readily understandable account of the characteristics, causes, and effects of climate.<b>John Hidore </b>is retired from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

Yet, gardeners are creating vegetable gardens with a difference; they are intended to be pleasing to the eye as well as a source for fresh produce. In an effort to beautify traditional vegetable gardens, landscape architects and amateur gardeners are finding inspiration in the elaborate European vegetable gardens of the seventeenth century. <i>Feast Your Eyes </i>examines the historical antecedents of this modern movement as well as the changing perceptions of the beauty of vegetable gardens over time and among different cultures. Generously illustrated with over one hundred historical and contemporary photographs and artwork highlighting material from the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Gardens, this book provides a fascinating and wide-ranging discussion of such topics as the vegetable garden at Versailles, Ming dynasty vegetable gardens, the war gardens of World War I, World War II victory gardens&#x2014;including those of the Japanese American internees&#x2014;and vegetable still lifes.<br><br>As the boundary between vegetable garden and flower garden has become blurred, the same is true for vegetables. Horticulturists have developed popular garden ornamentals from kale, chili peppers, sweet potato, and eggplant. Pennington provides "biographies" of these vegetables and describes new varieties that are being developed for their aesthetic qualities. She shows how this is not a uniquely modern phenomenon but is rooted in the introduction of exotic vegetables to Europe starting as early as the thirteenth century.<br><br><b>Published in association with Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service</b></p><p>"Using humble materials, Pennington tells a terrific story of the rise and fall of ornamental vegetable gardening between the seventeenth and the nineteenth centuries, and its comeback in the twentieth. The allure of her book is in its seamless lamination of scholarship and lucid narrative. The cast of supporting characters is made up of both familiar figures (Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Pope, etc.) and obscure heroes of horticulture and landscape architecture. Captivating and inspiring, this book will appeal to anyone who ever tried to grow something and eat it."&#x2014;Dean MacCannell, author of <i>The Tourist </i><b>Susan J. Pennington</b> was Enid A.

This, the thirteenth part of the volume, is the first history of Chinese mining to appear in a Western language. Spanning from the Neolithic period to the present day, it deals with the full range of Chinese mining from copper to mercury, arsenic to coal. The author explores not only the written sources but also the archaeological remains, and observes the traditional techniques still in use. The interrelationship between Chinese mining and its social, economic and political implications is examined. Through these discoveries, the author concludes that these factors were probably more important in determining how mining was carried out than the technological progress itself.</p><p>This is the first history of Chinese mining to appear in a western language and covers all aspects of mining from the Neolithic period to the present day. The author draws extensively not only on written material but on his own observations of traditional techniques in use today. He includes many illustrations from traditional Chinese sources and from his own photographs taken at mining sites. The technology is placed in the context of the political, social and economic conditions and comparisons are made with other mining practices."...very real achievement and contribution on producing this invaluable volume. It will be widely welcomed and used, particularly by those interested in mining history."

Using examples from both economics and politics, it covers cooperative and non-cooperative game theory illustrating the breadth and depth of its influence on economics. The book begins with an introduction to the subject, followed by a chapter on two-person zero-sum games with (Nash) noncooperative equilibrium for n-person noncooperative games, touching on both uniqueness of equilibrium and on games of incomplete information. Middle chapters treat the most recent material on noncooperative supergames and trigger strategy equilibria, cooperation supported by self-enforcing agreements, and refinements of the Nash noncooperative equilibrium such as perfect equilibrium and sequential equilibrium. Later chapters cover two person cooperative games and solution concepts for cooperative games having transferable utility. The final chapter deals with the generalizations of the core and the Shapley value to nontransferable utility games. Realistic examples and problems from economic literature appear in every chapter, illustrating the wide scope of the theory&#39;s applications in economics.</p><p></p><h2>Art on the edge: Creators and situations</h2><p>"As a stylist, in his descriptions of art and movements and books, Rosenberg has no equal. . . .

Max Beckmann might have been talking about his life as much as his brutally honest and dazzlingly choreographic paintings, for, when he died on a New York street corner in 1950, he had lived one of the most excoriatingly self-critical lives in modern art He left behind a body of work spanning five decades, work that found its direction and energy in the Paris of the 1920&#39;s. A magnet to artists, Paris gave Beckmann the creative competition he craved. Travelling there regularly (and settling there later), he mixed Freely with the likes of Matisse, Picasso and Delaunay, formulating a style that grew out of the passionate relationship between the German and French avant-garde. But Beckmann was always his own man, and while he soaked up the artistic fervour of the Parisian cafes and ateliers, he maintained a critical distance that allowed him to develop an intensely personal technique and oeuvre.

Designed to be easily incorporated into any curriculum, each module helps students integrate the knowledge, skills, self-awareness, and critical thinking abilities required for dealing with ethical issues. From applying basic ethical standards of practice to managing complex ethical dilemmas, this textbook equips readers with a range of tools and strategies for responding to ethical questions and concerns.<br> <br>Traditional ethics textbooks provide students with a model for ethical decision making. This breakthrough textbook goes beyond ethical decision making by providing students with a strategic framework for managing ethical issues that includes guidelines for engaging others in ethical discussions and using conflict resolution theory to promote collaborative solutions. Some textbooks introduce students to ethical theories, such as deontology, teleology, and virtue ethics. This textbook goes beyond describing these theories by providing students with opportunities to apply, compare, and contrast these approaches as they relate to various contexts of social work practice. A wealth of case scenarios, discussion questions, and role-play exercises make this an engaging, thought-provoking teaching and learning tool.<br> <br>At a basic level, this textbook teaches students the essential principles and standards that define ethical practice. At a more profound level, <em>Ethics and Values in Social Work</em> inspires students to reach for the highest values of profession: service, dignity and worth of the person, human relationships, integrity, competence, social justice, human rights, and scientific inquiry.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Allan Edward Barsky</strong>, MSW, JD, PhD, is Professor of Social Work at Florida Atlantic University.<br><br>"Barsky's six stages of ethical management is a model that will be widely used and cited in the future, and this text will likely emerge as the definitive study on social work ethics. The integration of the gripping case examples and theory of ethics is superior."--Katherine van Wormer, Professor of Social Work, University of Northern Iowa<p></p><br>"...extensive and authoritative...while utilizing an easy-to-read writing style and a wealth of examples embedded in well conceived classroom exercises....There are many strengths to this book that are often absent in similar texts."--<em>Journal of Social Work Values and Ethics</em><p></p><br>"This text is ideal for exploring both theoretical and practical aspects of social work ethics. Students benefit from the varied and thought-provoking scenarios given. The extensive glossary is very helpful and not seen in other texts on ethics." --Claudia J.

He sheds light on the literary sources that influenced Faulkner&#39;s early work and the technical innovations and general themes Faulkner was to develop in the later writing.<p><b>Cleanth Brooks</b> (1906--1994) was born in Kentucky, and educated at Vanderbilt, Tulane, and Oxford where he was a Rhodes scholar. He began his teaching career at Louisiana State University in 1932.

He lives in Los Angeles."Christopher Farnsworth's taut thriller <i>Blood Oath</i> is an irresistible page-turner.... A complex and unnervingly realistic tale in which vampire Nathaniel Cade is far less of a monster than his human colleagues at the CIA and FBI.

With vampires." <br> -Brad Meltzer, author of <i>The Book of Fate</i> <br><br> "<i>Blood Oath</i> is the vampire novel that finally gets it right. Christopher Farnsworth has done his homework in places where most writers wouldn't even know to look-and the result is a rollicking tale of the supernatural grounded in some of the true oddities of American history. If Dan Brown wrote a vampire thriller, this would be it." <br> -Mitch Horowitz, author of <i>Occult America</i> <br><br> "As someone who thinks Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> has never been bettered, and who would happily stick a stake through the heart of most modern vampire fiction, it almost pains me to say how much I enjoyed <i>Blood Oath</i>.

He lives with his family somewhere in the south of England. <i>The Unlikely Adventures of Mabel Jones</i> is his first book. Another one is coming soon.<p></p><p></p><b>Chapter 4 </b><br><b><i> The List</i></b><br><br>Yesterday morning Mabel Jones had eaten two bowls of cornflakes for breakfast. Then she&#x2019;d had another one. Then she&#x2019;d had a slice of toast with strawberry jam for dessert. She&#x2019;d spread the jam all the way to the edge to make it easier to eat the crusts. Then she&#x2019;d gone to school.<br><br>This morning Mabel Jones had a feeling that she probably wouldn&#x2019;t be going to school.<br><br>This morning she was sitting on a barrel in the cabin of a pirate ship, surrounded by a crew of excited animal pirates. It was actually surprisingly similar to being at school, except instead of a nice principal called Mr. Dobson, there was an evil wolf called Captain Idryss Ebenezer Split.<br><br>The captain unfolded a piece of paper, and the excited chatter of the crew died down into an expectant silence as he placed it on the table in front of him.<br><br>Split turned to Mabel. His muzzle was so close to her face she could see strings of wet drool between his half-open jaws.<br><br>&#x201c;On this page are written the names of the creatures who stand between me and my destiny. The treacherous bunch of scumbags who stole my rightful inheritance when they mutinied against their captain, my father.&#x201d;<br><br>The crew tutted and shook their heads disapprovingly.<br><br>Split pulled at the necklace that hung from his neck. Suspended from the rusting chain was a lump of dull black metal.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye! Each one of them has a piece like this, stolen from my poor, dearly departed father.&#x201d;<br> Pelf leaned in close to Mabel. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of an X!&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;A what?&#x201d; she whispered back.<br><br>&#x201c;The letter X! And we all know what the letter X marks, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> Mabel frowned.<br><br> &#x201c;Do we?&#x201d; she asked, forgetting to whisper this time.<br><br> The captain&#x2019;s lip curled back to reveal purple gums.<br><br> &#x201c;Somewhere, snuglet, somewhere far away, in the Haunted Seventh Sea, there is a spot. A spot that&#x2019;s missing its X. I alone knows that spot, and soon I will have all five pieces of the X!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But why do you need the X if you already know the spot?&#x201d; asked Mabel, wrinkling her nose.<br><br> Split growled and his boggled eye boggled more than usual.<br><br> &#x201c;Because this particular X don&#x2019;t just mark the spot. It&#x2019;s also a key!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A key?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Aye, a key. A key forged in a time long since sunken into the greasy soup of history.&#x201d;<br> Split pointed to a porthole. &#x201c;See there! In the sky. The burning comet!&#x201d;<br><br> Mabel and the pirates followed his gaze. Sure enough, a little way above the horizon, a light glowed white in the sky. Split traced a path through the air with his cutlass.<br><br> &#x201c;The comet passes just once every hundred years. And while it shines in the sky, if the X is completed and placed correctly, it will unlock a treasure. The most amazing treasure known to beast or hooman.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Chests of precious jewels!&#x201d; cried Pelf.<br><br> &#x201c;Piles of golden coins!&#x201d; croaked Old Sawbones.<br><br> &#x201c;Priceless works of fine art!&#x201d; squealed Milton Melton Mowbray.<br><br> Captain Split smiled wickedly.<br><br> &#x201c;Aye, lads. Something like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br> Pelf removed a star chart from his fleece and unfolded it proudly.<br><br> &#x201c;According to my expert calculations, the comet should&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re holding the chart upside down,&#x201d; said Mabel Jones.<br><br> Pelf turned the chart the other way around.<br><br> &#x201c;Aye. According to my calculations, the comet should cross the sky over the next fourteen days.&#x201d;<br><br> Captain Split turned to his crew.<br><br> &#x201c;And so we have to gather every piece of the X from the names on this list and reach the spot before the fortnight is out!&#x201d;<br><br> He lovingly smoothed the tattered list with a paw.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been carried across six of the seven seas by bird and by boat&#x2014;&#x201d; Split smiled wickedly&#x2014;&#x201c;but it&#x2019;s never once been read.&#x201d;<br><br> The captain&#x2019;s paw shot out and, grabbing Mabel Jones by the collar of her pajamas, lifted her clean off the ground. His single eye fixed on her as she dangled in the air. She could feel his claws digging into her skin.<br><br> &#x201c;And now we have a reader!&#x201d;<br><br> Split let go of Mabel and she fell to the floor.<br><br> &#x201c;Me?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You,&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;So read it!&#x201d;<br><br> Mabel picked up the list and studied it closely. It was going to be difficult to read with the whole crew watching, especially as the words were faded and all joined up.<br><br> Taking a deep breath, Mabel Jones began to read:<br><br> &#x201c;Macaroni.&#x201d;<br><br> The captain looked at the crew.<br><br> &#x201c;Does anyone know this varmint that goes by the name MacGroany?&#x201d;<br><br> The crew shook their heads.<br><br> The captain banged his fist against the table.<br><br> &#x201c;When I find that treacherous creature MacGroany, I&#x2019;ll rip his head off and throw it to the seagulls!&#x201d;<br><br> The crew cheered!<br><br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s next on the list, Mabel?&#x201d; asked Pelf the goat.<br><br> Mabel continued to read:<br><br> &#x201c;Cheddar cheese.&#x201d;<br><br> The crew looked at each other again, shaking their heads. He wasn&#x2019;t a pirate they were familiar with either.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tie him to a carnivorous squid!&#x201d; cried the captain, snapping a chair in half.<br><br> Mabel continued reading the list:<br><br> &#x201c;Mustard.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So ferocious he&#x2019;s known by a single name!&#x201d; gasped Old Sawbones.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stuff him like a mackerel,&#x201d; whispered the captain, curling his lip to reveal his razor-sharp teeth.<br><br> The crew winced.<br><br> Mabel looked at the captain politely. &#x201c;Shall I finish?&#x201d;<br><br> The last item was written in a different handwriting.<br><br> &#x201c;Lemon juice,&#x201d; read Mabel.<br><br> &#x201c;Lemon Juice?&#x201d;<br><br> The crew looked at one another in confusion. Finally Pelf spoke.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a shopping list, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, I think so.&#x201d; Mabel smiled apologetically at the crew.<br><br> The captain&#x2019;s single eye boggled with rage. Throwing back his head, he howled the loudest howl ever heard by man or beast. He drew his cutlass and swung it angrily through the air, twisting it into the heart of an imaginary enemy. Then he turned to point it at Mabel.<br><br> &#x201c;Then I guess that makes you pretty useless, snuglet!&#x201d;<br><br> Omynus Hussh appeared from the shadows.<br><br> &#x201c;Slice her open, Captain! She&#x2019;s made you look a fool!&#x201d;<br><br> But Mabel wasn&#x2019;t even listening. She was thinking.<br><br> Something wasn&#x2019;t quite right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br> Somewhere deep inside her head a thought was waking up and scratching itself.<br><br> Why is the last item written by a different hand?<br><br> Then that thought rudely poked a new thought awake with a bony finger.<br><br> And why would you need lemon juice in what is obviously a recipe for macaroni and cheese?<br><br> Lemon juice?<br><br> Lemon juice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br> Lemon. Juice.<br><br> LEMON JUICE!<br><br> Spinning away from the captain&#x2019;s sword, Mabel Jones held the list above a candle.<br><br> &#x201c;Go on, burns it!&#x201d; scoffed Omynus Hussh. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s as worthless as a girl on a pirate ship.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not burning it. Just look!&#x201d; cried Mabel.<br><br> The crew gasped as they looked at the list. Below the recipe for bangers and mash with gravy, new words were forming&#x2014;and this time they were names.<br><br> &#x201c;Invisible ink!&#x201d; declared Mabel proudly. &#x201c;The heat from the flame turns the invisible words written in lemon juice brown!&#x201d;<br><br> The crew burst into applause.<br><br> &#x201c;The girl&#x2019;s a marvel!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A brainbox!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;d have thought it?!&#x201d;<br><br> Mabel placed the list on the table and the crew gathered around as she began to read.<br><br> &#x201c;The Mutineers of the Flying Slug: Bartok the Brute.&#x201d;<br><br> Now wait a second while I find my Who&#x2019;s Who of Pirates sticker album. Yes, it is complete, apart from a sticker of &#x201c;Elusive&#x201d; Jack Carrot, the Rabbit Assassin. No one has ever managed to collect that sticker.

Well, you get the picture.<br><br> Mabel continues:<br><br> &#x201c;Ishmael H. Toucan.&#x201d;<br><br> Found him! Under the subsection &#x201c;Former Pirates,&#x201d; for his fortune was made as a whaler of the Cold Gray Sea. He shares his entry with his brother, Abel, and holds records for both harpooning and whale butchery.<br><br> &#x201c;The passenger, Count Anselmo Klack.&#x201d;<br><br> No entry for the Count. I guess he is not a real pirate. He is a count, though, which is a mark of badness, if ever I saw one.<br><br> &#x201c;Old Hoss.&#x201d;<br><br> Ah, Old Hoss the sheep! I know him well. And so does Captain Split, for Old Hoss carved the captain&#x2019;s bone leg. Here&#x2019;s his sticker in the &#x201c;Smuggling and Thievery&#x201d; section! A dastardly sheep who would steal from his own mother if he hadn&#x2019;t already pushed her off a cliff.<br><br> The captain flashed a wicked fanged grin and addressed the happy crew.<br><br> &#x201c;All hands on deck, boys! Today we sail and tomorrow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tomorrow we steal!&#x201d;<br><br> Mabel looked up.<br><br> &#x201c;So can I go home now, please?&#x201d;<br><br> Split laughed a nasty laugh.<br><br> &#x201c;There ain&#x2019;t no way home for you, snuglet. When a hooman child commits the Deed, it opens a porthole between your world and ours, so we pirates can go through and bag &#x201c;em. But once we&#x2019;ve snatched the wriggling snuglet and come back through the porthole, then it closes behind us.&#x201d;<br> Mabel gulped. &#x201c;You mean I&#x2019;m trapped here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. forever?&#x201d;<br><br> Split leaned in close to her, his hot wolf breath stinking up all her face holes at once.�<br><br> &#x201c;Well, now you mention it, there is one way back. Remember how I told you the X is a key?&#x201d;<br> Mabel nodded.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, one of the things that key can open is a porthole back to the hooman world. So here&#x2019;s the deal: if you help us find them missing bits of X, then maybe, when I&#x2019;ve got my treasure, I&#x2019;ll open a porthole that will take you back home.&#x201d;<br><br> Split grinned an evil grin.<br><br> &#x201c;Meantime fear not, snuglet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;ll look after you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><h2>Operation Snakebite</h2><p>Coming up to Christmas, and reporter Stephen Grey is embedded with B Company, 2 Yorks, in southern Afghanistan during Operation Snakebite.

Hinton</h2><p>Why should there be only three dimensions in space? Do we have a four-dimensional existence, but are we not conscious of it? If there are four dimensions, why not more than four - up to an infinite number? Pursuing such questions as these, Charles H. Hinton (1853-1907) speculated brilliantly on the idea of the fourth dimension, and in his best writings - which have here been brought together for the first time in one volume - he can finally be recognized as one of the most entertaining speculative thinkers of the turn of the century. Including material from all but three sections of Scientific Romances (1884-5), his most important writings from every stage of his career have been judiciously chosen and sympathetically edited for this anthology: &#34;What is the Fourth Dimension?&#34; (his first published essay), &#34;A Plane World&#34; (about life in two dimensions), &#34;A Picture of Our Universe,&#34; &#34;Casting Out the Self&#34; (setting forth the ideas regarding his famous cubes), &#34;Many Dimensions,&#34; &#34;An Unfinished Communication,&#34; &#34;A New Era of Thought,&#34; &#34;The Fourth Dimension,&#34; &#34;The Recognition of the Fourth Dimension,&#34; and &#34;An Episode of Flatland,&#34; a delightful journey to the same fictional world that E. A. Abbott created in his classic book, Flatland. Hinton was one of the first mathematicians to write at length about the fourth dimension. He anticipated many of Einstein&#39;s discoveries, and - what&#39;s even more astonishing - he did so analogically, without the aid of any experimental data. Many of his ideas are still debated in scientific circles. In addition to making the selection for what promises to be the standard Hinton anthology, Professor Rudolf v.B. Rucker - well-known for his own speculations on the fourth dimension in Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension - has written a valuable introduction which assesses the scope of Hinton&#39;s contribution and outlines his entire career.</p><p></p><h2>Lee Kuan Yew, the man and his ideas</h2><p>Used.

At the age of 93 she published &#34;Other People&#34; which chronicled her life between 1963 and 1966 when she was struggling to come to terms with the deaths of both her husband Ralph and her son Burgo. This sequel to that volume follows her life between the years 1967 and 1970. With the support of friends, who included Julia Strachey, Robert Kee, Raymond Mortimer, Rosamund Lehmann and Gerald Brenan, travelling and her unfailing interest in the world outside, Partridge comes to terms with existence after her twofold loss. She is endlessly observant of nature and people, and has an acerbic sense of humour, a refusal to indulge in self-pity and, perhaps above all, a passion for conversation.</p><p>Frances Partridge was born in Bedford Square in 1900. Family friends included Henry James, Conan Doyle and various members of the Strachey family. She has translated many books and with her husband Ralph edited the Greville Memoirs.</p><h2>The Big 12: My Personal Confidence-Building Principles for Achieving Total Success</h2><p><p><b>Dr. Jesse Duplantis</b> shares a collection of 12 life-principles that he has personally used to achieve success in his own life and ministry in his latest book, <i>The Big 12: My Personal Confidence-Building Principles for Achieving Total Success.</i></p> <p>Aimed at motivating people to live a more focused, authentic, and passionate life, each of the principles delivers wisdom from God's Word along with practical advice from the heart of Dr. Duplantis to help you navigate your own path to success.</p> <p> Whether you are pursuing a dream, want to go further in your vision, or just have a practical life-goal that you want to see met,&nbsp;<i>The Big 12: My Personal Confidence-Building Principles for Achieving Total Success</i>&nbsp;will inspire you to be bold, go for what God has put on your heart with confidence, and achieve the success you want in your life. </p></p><p><p><b>Jesse Duplantis</b> is a dynamic evangelist who has traveled throughout the world since 1978 preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

Sailor, engineer, and retired naval captain, he lives on Virginia's Eastern Shore with novelist and poet Lenore Hart and their daughter.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> </p><p><br> <b>A Stolen Pistol � Dawn in Richmond, Attended by Ravens � A Messenger from the Navy Department � Disappointing Conversation with Commodore Rousseau � Arrival of a National Dignitary</b> </p><p><br> The first thing Ker Claiborne realized that morning was not that this was the day he was to fight a duel, but that his monkey was no longer in the bed beside him. The sheets still smelled of ape, but the animal wasn't there. </p><p> Rubbing his eyes, peering across the room in the vibrating grisly light that preceded dawn, it took him some seconds to make out the furry shape of C. Auguste Dupin, holding one of his master's pistols. And even then sighting down the barrel at him. </p><p> Fully and suddenly awake, he threw the coverlet back. Then froze, hearing the ratcheting click of the hammer being pulled to cock. Remembering how intently the beast had observed him as he cleaned, oiled, and loaded the finely crafted Bertrand &amp; Javalet. How he'd watched his master extend the weapon, aim, and squeeze. </p><p> Hurling himself from the bedclothes, Ker cuffed the pistol aside just as it went off. The washbasin exploded, showering him with water, bits of Wedgwood, and jagged splinters off the corner of a carved oak Bible box dated 1709, when the Wythes had arrived in the New World. Then all was pandemonium in his father-in-law's house. Screams came from the other bedrooms. His own was a reeking box of sulphurous smoke. The howling, chattering ape ricocheted along the baseboards like a squirrel with its tail afire. </p><p> -- Ker, are you all right in there? </p><p> The voice outside his door belonged to his father-in-law, old Thomas Wythe. -- Quite all right, sir, Ker called. </p><p> -- What's that? </p><p> He raised his voice. -- I said, thank you for your concern. Only an accidental discharge, while loading my sidearm. </p><p> Ker lunged, collaring Dupin by the nape with one hand and scooping up the weapon with the other. He replaced it in the case and set the lock, then remembered he'd done exactly that the night before. The monkey tried desperately to sink its teeth into his arm. Really, he could see why his wife had lost patience with it. She'd found it in their nursery, holding their toddler upon the windowsill. She'd told him in no uncertain terms that if he was going to Richmond, it was going with him. </p><p> A knock. He opened the door to find Wythe and his young cousin Harker Bowen in rumpled nightdress. Wythe's pepperbox revolver was pointed at the floor. -- Rather early to be loading a pistol, Ker, he observed. </p><p> -- I have an early appointment, sir. </p><p> -- May I ask what sort of appointment? </p><p> -- The kind which requires a loaded pistol. He met the older man's gaze and saw he understood; saw also he ached to ask more. But of course could not. Ker bowed. -- If you'll excuse me. </p><p> -- Certainly, said Harker. Down the hallway, his mother-in-law, dressed only in a loose cotton volante, turned away too. Only Wythe lingered. He pressed Ker's arm. -- Who? </p><p> -- A man of no consequence to you. A naval acquaintance. </p><p> -- If he is of no consequence, why, you need not take the field. </p><p> -- I wish it were avoidable, but it is not. I left letters in the Bible box for Catherine and Robert. Will you make sure they get them? If necessary? </p><p> His father-in-law blinked, stroking a graying mustache. -- Of course I will. You're wearing fresh linen, my boy? </p><p> -- Yes sir. </p><p> -- Then God be with you, son, and may He have mercy on us all. </p><p><br> When Wythe had gone downstairs Ker stropped his Canton, then guided the razor around mustache and small Vandyke. He combed his hair, which he'd allowed to grow out to cover his ears, and threw on his one presentable suit of civilian clothing, a brown sack, with an embroidered vest, black cravat, soft-brimmed hat. Dupin gibbered to himself in the corner, turning over the shattered pieces of crockery. </p><p> As he drew on yellow kid gloves Ker's amusement faded, replaced by a cold rawness to reality, to each passing second, as if his nerves had been skinned. This could be the day he died. Perhaps it was as well he'd left his wife and son in Norfolk. If the worst happened...too late to think of that. No gentleman could neglect a challenge. He could face death. To lose one's honor...for their sake as much as his, <i>that</i> one could not contemplate. </p><p> A small, cased ambrotype of a dark-haired woman stood on the sideboard. Ker looked into Catherine's eyes for a moment, kissed the cool glass, then folded the case with a snap and pocketed it. He tucked the pistol-box under one arm, and the struggling ape under the other. At the landing he handed Dupin to a startled servant, along with a silver coin that closed her open mouth. </p><p><br> The sun had not yet risen. As he turned his gelding's head for the river, the hills were taking shape from misty darkness. The sloping land carried him easily down toward the James. To his right rose the church spires and tobacco warehouses of the city, crowned by the Parthenon-like Capitol. A repeated, metallic clanging rang from the Tredegar Ironworks. The tap of drums began in the distance, reveille tattooing from the militia encampments on Chimborazo Plain and Maddox Hill. As Aquila neared the river its voices rose to meet them, the rush and chuckle of rapids and the groaning of mill wheels. </p><p> As he rode, his thoughts slipped back to the decision that had brought him here. U.S.S. <i>Owanee</i> had returned from Africa to find the country splitting like a rotten stick. Every Southerner in the Navy had to make a decision. Stay with the old flag, or follow his home country into an unimaginable future. Ker had revered the Stars and Stripes. It meant government by consent of the governed, freedom to strive and live according to one's own lights. </p><p> Only gradually did he realize that the Lincolnian victory had given it a different import: shackling unwilling states into a union now hostile to an entire society. Till at last he'd acknowledged, heart like cold stone, that it was not for him to divide prudence from folly, right from wrong, and loyalty from treason. Virginia had seceded, and he as much as any Spotsylvania farmer was bound by that sovereign act. </p><p> Lieutenant Henry Lomax Minter had seen his gradual process of decision in a different light. </p><p> A hail; his mount shied, and Ker gentled it, patting its neck. He called in a low voice, -- Good morning, Jennings. </p><p> Obadiah Jennings Wise was tall and dark, and sat his horse with the grace of a rider from childhood. He too was in civilian clothes, a tweed coat and hunting breeches, though he was in the Light Infantry Blues. Wise was the passionately secessionist editor of the Richmond <i>Enquirer</i> and a dedicated duelist. Jennings, as his friends called him, had been with Ker in the bar of the Spotswood Hotel when Minter had passed insulting words. </p><p> Wise indicated the box under his arm. -- You needn't to bring your own, you know. </p><p> -- I'm sorry, this is my first time. They're not unknown where I grew up, but they're rare. And of course, in the Navy -- </p><p> -- Prohibited? </p><p> -- Very much so. </p><p> They cantered toward a silver-rose glow nestled within gradually bleaching darkness. Lofty shadows resolved themselves into ships off the City Dock, awaiting their turn to take on flour and tobacco. -- Shall I review the formalities, then? </p><p> -- Please do. </p><p> -- I met with Mr. Valentine last night. He engaged as Minter's second, you will recall. We attempted to settle the matter before proceeding to the ground. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach an honorable conclusion. Unless, of course, you wish to drop the challenge? </p><p> -- It was not I who challenged. </p><p> -- It was you who gave Minter the lie. </p><p> Ker cleared his throat, obscurely irritated by the punctilio, the forms. -- Not so. It was he who lied, in his intimation I remained with the Union too long, and for base reasons. </p><p> Wise said briskly, -- Then the quarrel is irreconcilable, and we must proceed to the ground. Once there, we will dismount, see to the weapons and make our final dispositions. Remember, to take more than three seconds aiming is ungentlemanly. Let us canter; the morning is growing bright. </p><p> He urged his mount forward, and they rode down out of the cover of the oaks that shaded the grounds of Hollywood Cemetery into the sloping open that ran along the edge of the canal. Beyond, the James burned with the steadily focusing light of the incipiently rising sun. </p><p> Two silhouettes, horses and men, spurred forward from behind a stone-built canal house. Ker recognized Valentine, and beside him a clean-shaven, freckle-faced young firebrand whose red-blond hair fell nearly to his collar. </p><p> Henry Lomax Minter's piercing green eyes examined Ker, then Wise as the latter rode up to them. Wise lifted his hat, a salute the others returned. </p><p> Ker sat his horse, listening to the denial of ravens as they discussed the oncoming day. The poetry of a man he'd once met returned to him. His lips moved, whispering the word. Nevermore to see his wife. Nevermore dandle his son. Nor see the sun rise, nor heed the dark music of the night sea. </p><p> He drew a slow breath, dismissing regret. No choice remained to him but to fight. For this was what honor meant: to back one's conduct with one's lifeblood, and to demand of others the same accountability. Without that base, that rock, beneath the relation of man and man, what sort of society could exist? Some things were worth a life. So be it! </p><p> Valentine and Minter separated, and the latter swung down to the dew-laden grass. Ker dismounted too. A black boy ran from the cottage and caught up their bridles. He felt in his purse and tossed the servant a dime, conscious, as he did so, that each commonplace act might be the last. The thought gave each moment a significance beyond itself. The raven-croaking dawn, the silver shimmer of the river, the hoarse panting of the gelding as it was led away, seemed to carry a message beyond words that he could almost for a moment interpret. The very leaves seemed to tremble with sympathy and, yes, with <i>joy</i>. If this were his last day, by God, it was a lovely one! </p><p> -- Mr. Minter, he said. -- I trust I find you well this morning. </p><p> Minter bent the brim of his hat but did not extend his hand. -- Very well indeed, Mr. Claiborne. Somehow his lazy-voweled Mississippi speech sounded both carefree and menacing. </p><p> -- You persist in saying I behaved dishonorably? </p><p> -- I only state the truth, sir. You captained a vessel for the Republican scum, even after Sumter. For the pay, or due to a sluggish liver -- does it really matter why? </p><p> -- We should have no more speech, said Wise, striding up to them. He thumbed out his watch, then glanced at the sun, which had just appeared as a stamped-out disc of heated iron above Chimborazo Hill. -- Once met upon the ground, principals may only exchange greetings. Mr. Valentine and I have charged my pistols single load and single shot, on our honor and in each other's presence. Is this ground acceptable? </p><p> -- Uh huh, Minter said, squinting at the sun. His manner was cool, his expression ironic, but as the light grew Ker saw he looked pale. Ker agreed too, feeling detached from the proceedings, as if he were watching from the far bank of the river. </p><p> Jennings's big single-shot pistol dragged his arm earthward. The ball would be deadly at close range. He'd watched men die of sepsis, of stomach wounds. He swallowed, suddenly terrified. Not of death, but of dying. <i>Lord, forgive this act of folly; forgive us both.</i> </p><p> -- The principals are ready? said Wise. -- Back to back, then. Ten paces, to march at my count; then turn and fire. Ready. </p><p> Straightening his shoulders, lifting hollow steel to the brightening clouds, he felt Minter's back against his own. In a moment he'd try to kill this other man. This former shipmate. No Southern gentleman could have acted otherwise. Why then did it strike him suddenly as inexplicable, as uncanny? Could it be, he suddenly wondered, that Minter might be right? That some subterranean motive, like a deep-buried spring beneath reason and explication, had made him delay for a reason darker than he admitted even to himself? </p><p> Even now, did he not yearn for reconciliation with the flag he'd served so long? </p><p> At that moment he heard distant thunder. He did not move or look. He waited, pistol raised, thoughtless and at peace, for the command to pace, and turn, and fire. </p><p> The thunder resolved into hoofbeats, growing closer, louder. </p><p> -- Lieutenants Minter and Claiborne? called an unfamiliar, peremptory voice. -- These proceedings are against military law and regulation, and are declared null and postponed until the cessation of hostilities. By order of the Honorable Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Confederate States Navy. You will both accompany me at once. </p><p><br> They dismounted a block west of the Capitol, before the four-story brick pile that had till a week before been the Mechanic's Institute. Now the War and Navy Departments of the new government divided it between them. Early though it was yet, workmen in canvas trowsers and red neckerchiefs were carrying lumber and paint buckets, and hammers clattered deafeningly in the stairwell. Climbing to the second floor, Ker could not help contrasting plain new desks and chairs, bare floorboards and freshly whitewashed wainscoting with the decaying carpets and general fustiness at Main Navy in Washington. He'd left his card here without response. Now, it seemed, they'd pulled whatever string demanded attention. He wished he was in uniform. -- Can you tell us the nature of this summons? he asked their escort again, a dandyish, barely civil young fellow who'd introduced himself as Mr. Quoddy. </p><p> -- I told you, I'm only the clerk. </p><p> -- We're to see Mr. Mallory, is that what I'm to understand? </p><p> -- Oh, hardly. Quoddy paused at a door and put his ear to it. He rapped, then shooed them inside. -- The Secretary is occupied with important matters. You're for Commodore Rousseau. </p><p> Ker's heart sank. Lawrence Rousseau, chief of the Bureau of Orders and Detail, was a snarling bruin of the old school. Minter stood aside for Ker -- he was senior, or had been when they'd both written USN after their names. He came to attention before the mahogany schoolmaster's desk. -- Lieutenant Ker Claiborne, reporting as ordered. </p><p> -- Lieutenant Henry Minter, reporting as ordered. </p><p> Before him, not so much manning as overwhelming the desk, sprawled a bulky, white-maned old man in dress blues. Ker had known Rousseau was very senior, but was not prepared for decrepitude. The Commodore's long hair was white and silky, and his skin, where it was not mottled by age, almost transparent. His hand trembled as he handed a paper to Quoddy, then blinked up with vague, wandering, watery eyes. </p><p> -- These are the young gentlemen who were playing at a duel? he demanded sharply. </p><p> Behind him Quoddy grinned. Minter said nothing, so Ker had to respond. -- Yes sir. </p><p> -- Claiborne and...Winter? </p><p> -- Minter, sir. </p><p> -- Academy whelps, no doubt. </p><p> -- I am class of '56, sir...</p></p><h2>Abe Sapien Volume 5: Sacred Places</h2><p>Haunted by deaths he&#39;s seen and ones he&#39;s caused, Abe returns to the place where he was shot, where his latest transformation began.

A talented dancer, her fluid movements turned the heads of people pushing squeaky shopping carts. Petite and lithe in her shorts and a halter top that bared her back and slim midriff, Gail breezed past the brightly stocked shelves with feline grace. She rolled to a stop in the beverage aisle. Her hazel eyes scanned the prepared drink mixes until she found what she wanted&#x2014;a bottle of pre-mixed, non-alcoholic pi�a colada drink. She took it off the shelf with a willowy hand, her thin fingers and thumb adorned with several rings, and took it to the express lane. It was a Friday afternoon in New York and it looked like the bright, sexy 23-year-old college dropout who worked as a bartender was on her way to a party. A pi�a colada party.<br>Gail Katz skated out into the warm afternoon and over the downtown pavement toward her fifth-floor walkup apartment on West 14th Street. She closed the door behind her but did not lock it. Alone in her apartment, she put the bottle of creamy coconut, pineapple juice and sugar syrup aside on the kitchen counter and picked up the phone. She called her parents on Long Island and chatted awhile. Manny and Sylvia Katz ran a stationery store on the Island where Gail grew up. Her younger sister Alayne was in college and their brother Steve was in the fourth grade. For a change, Gail did not squabble with her mother. Before hanging up, Gail made plans to get together with the family soon. She then called several friends, had similar conversations and made plans.<br>After she finished her calls, Gail put on some music, got a bottle of vodka out of the cabinet and blended it with ice and the pi�a colada mix, producing the familiar frothy, festive beverage. The sweet smell of coconut filled the small kitchen. Gail knew pi�a colada should be laced with rum but she didn&#x2019;t have any. Her favorite drinks were pi�a colada and a liqueur named Kir. She took the pitcher of the potent aperitif, a straw and a single glass, and headed for the bathroom.<br>Gail gazed briefly in the medicine cabinet mirror at the strong nose dividing the delicate features of her pretty, tanned oval face. From inside the medicine cabinet, she took a plastic bottle of thick, round white pills. She brought everything into the bedroom and put it on the night table. She got a pencil and a pad of paper and also put them on the night table before crawling into bed and pouring a frosty white glassful of pi�a colada. One by one, Gail popped snowy Quaaludes into her mouth and washed them down by sipping the milky white cocktail, which tasted like an ice cream soda, through the straw. When her glass was empty, she filled it and continued her task. She didn&#x2019;t cry or become emotional. She was cold, dispassionate, deliberate. Gail was distant from herself, determined to escape her unbearable feelings of loneliness and disappointment.<br>&#x201c;People think I have everything to live for and be happy about but they don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; Gail thought, as she gulped the chalky tablets and washed them down with the icy cocktail.<br>She thought about people who tried to talk her out of her depression, who told her that she was young and smart and good-looking. She listened to her psychiatrist and her family and friends when they responded to her complaints but she couldn&#x2019;t help herself. Sometimes she could see their point&#x2014;faintly, as if through a blizzard, but their logic froze in the cold blast of her pain and misery.<br>The avalanche of iced booze chilled Gail from the inside out but the alcohol warmed her a bit. She picked up the pencil and drunkenly began to scrawl on paper all the reasons why she wanted to die. Unemotionally, Gail had made her phone calls to her family and friends because she intended to mask her plans. She wanted them to have a pleasant final memory of her. She didn&#x2019;t want them to blame themselves.<br>&#x201c;If our last conversation was pleasant,&#x201d; Gail thought, &#x201c;they can&#x2019;t reprimand themselves for not responding to my depression or pain.&#x201d;<br>She was determined to make sure that there was absolutely no indication of any problem or difficulty that they could reproach themselves for not having acted upon. Gail did not see that her plan might make her death more of a shock&#x2014;more powerful and mysterious&#x2014;to those who loved her. If she had, the fact that her effort to end her pain might freeze their hearts forever was not enough to stop her at that point.<br>Partially under a white sheet, she passed from drunk to anaesthetized when the &#x201c; &#x2019;ludes&#x201d; kicked in. Their depressant effect further frosted her mind, like a frigid climber on Mount Everest attacked by both frostbite and numbing hypothermia.<br>&#x201c;It feels like splitting,&#x201d; Gail decided. There were two opposing parts of her that were battling and she couldn&#x2019;t pacify either of them. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t make any sense,&#x201d; she thought. &#x201c;It eliminates and destroys.&#x201d;<br>The cold was separating Gail from herself but she was no longer in pain. Slumping into unconsciousness, she floated on a peaceful white cloud of sensual happiness.<br>Gail Katz whirled away in the wind like a snowflake.<br>Gail Beth Katz was born on March 8th, 1956, in Brooklyn. Almost two years later, her younger sister, brown-eyed Alayne, was born. They shared a red-and-white bedroom in their second-floor apartment. Little Gail had an imaginary friend in grammar school&#x2014;an older girl who scolded her and, once, ordered her to crawl around the house on her knees until blisters formed on her skin.<br>When Gail was in the fourth grade, her parents moved the family to a large, brick-and-shingle split-level home in the suburbs. Gail was an adorable child, a good student, and close to her little sister. By the time Gail graduated from grammar school and moved up to junior high school, she had acquired adolescent insecurities. In private, when she was reading, watching television or sleeping, she still sucked on her finger like a small child.<br>Gail discovered the opposite sex in the seventh grade and went boy-crazy, even scratching one guy&#x2019;s name into the flesh of her left arm with a razor blade when she was fourteen. Her lack of self-confidence seemed to drive her to seek constant attention from boys. From that time on, Gail always had a boyfriend. She never broke up with one until she had the next one lined up.<br>To neighbors, the Katz family seemed like every other happy suburban family, but underneath&#x2014;like most families&#x2014;there were undercurrents of conflict and money worries. Manny was the president of a specialty advertising company called Columbia Pen &amp; Pencil. When the business was sold to a large Florida firm, he planned to move his family to the Sunshine State and continue to run the concern as a division of the larger corporation. But his plans fell through and Manny was shut out of his ideal job among the beaches and palm trees. Instead, Manny took out a second mortgage on their nice split-level in order to buy a stationery store in West Hempstead. Running a little card shop in a quiet neighborhood was a big step down in the world for a guy who had run an entire company. Also, Sylvia was needed as an unpaid worker to help Manny in the shop, to make ends meet. In the summer, the kids some-times helped with the family business. Disappointed, carrying more debt and looking at bills for three kids and college on the horizon, Manny became stressed out and unhappy.<br>Some observers thought Sylvia seemed very flighty and high-strung, like Gail. Sylvia always seemed to be quarreling with her daughters. Steve, who was still young, realized his dad was under pressure and noticed that there were fewer good times. Sometimes Gail had arguments with her father that would end with neither father nor daughter speaking to the other for weeks, even though they ate at the same table, sat in the same room to watch TV and rode in the same car. Manny favored Alayne, who was more like him. He couldn&#x2019;t deal with the emotionality of Gail, who took after her mother. It seemed to Alayne that Sylvia put all her energy into helping Gail&#x2014;because she was so needy. Alayne would hear her parents arguing&#x2014;and sometimes yelling&#x2014;about Gail, with Sylvia trying to get Manny to be more sensitive to Gail&#x2019;s needs.<br>Gail was still an outstanding student and she graduated in 1973, a year early, from Mepham High School in Bellmore. She went to the State University of New York at Albany. The following year she roomed in an off-campus apartment with Alayne, who also came to the school. But Gail dropped out during her sophomore year, in 1975, when she lost interest in college and started using drugs. It did not please Manny and Sylvia, who had many arguments on the subject. Sylvia, of course, wanted her daughter to finish school and be able to make a living. But, being a Jewish mom from suburbia who had worked as a receptionist in a doctor&#x2019;s office, Sylvia had a rather typical ambition for her eldest daughter&#x2014;she wanted her to marry a doctor.<br>Alayne also took a year off but dropped back in. She transferred to another state school on Long Island. She did well and decided to enter law school after she graduated.<br>After she dropped out, Gail moved to Manhattan and entered a dance program at New York University. She moved with an easy grace and was a natural dancer. But the college dance scene left her dissatisfied and she again dropped out. She took a course in social work that she also dropped out of, and went back upstate. She dated musicians and tried to become involved in music and choreography but it led nowhere. Alayne, who occasionally visited her sister upstate, thought that some of the musicians Gail dated were crazy. Alayne felt her sister was lost&#x2014;she was going nowhere and didn&#x2019;t know how to get anywhere. Gail&#x2019;s family rejected her boyfriends as either too old, too young or not Jewish. They referred to her choices as &#x201c;Gail&#x2019;s reformation projects.&#x201d; Alayne felt that her older sister did not feel good about who she was, so she found damaged goods and tried to fix them.<br>In 1976, Gail lived in Albany with *Phil Lester, a musician in a local band. She made some efforts to choreograph the musicians&#x2019; movements. She wanted to somehow dance with the band during performances but that also never worked out.<br>Upstate, Gail became friends with another band member named *Amanda Klein, who played synthesizer and guitar and wrote songs. Amanda, who had been a model, was a striking 5-foot-11 beauty. The two discussed their lives and loves. Gail was torn between her love of creative people and her yearning to make a life for herself, to fulfill the goal she shared with her mother&#x2014;to marry a doctor. In fact, Gail&#x2019;s therapist was also onboard with the doctor plan. They all felt that Gail needed security and stability. That way, she wouldn&#x2019;t have to work odd jobs to pay the rent and could go back to school and get a degree. Phil was a very handsome, talented musician and a nice guy but he wasn&#x2019;t a doctor and would probably never be rich.<br>So, while Gail was with Phil, she was secretly looking around for better prospects. That was her style&#x2014;she would test-drive a new guy before she broke up with the old one.<br>Amanda liked Gail, who she thought was intelligent and a sweet person but very emotional. Sometimes it seemed all Gail did was complain about how miserable she was and how Phil did not measure up to her expectations. Gail had a lot of friendships with women and she seemed to get something emotionally from her girlfriends that she didn&#x2019;t get from her boyfriends. She was distrustful of men, perhaps with good reason, but saw them as potential rescuers who could save her from the life of a loser. Amanda wondered what fears Gail&#x2019;s mother had communicated to her daughter to make her such an insecure young woman, searching for a man to take care of her. Gail, thought Amanda, was definitely a glass-is-half-empty kind of person. She was having trouble finding a calling in life. She seemed to be always starting and stopping things. She loved dancing but it seemed her real passion was herself&#x2014;her soul-searching, her pursuit of happiness. Maybe she wasn&#x2019;t so different from everybody else, after all, Amanda thought.<br>&#x201c;I feel so sad,&#x201d; Gail repeatedly whined to Amanda. &#x201c;I feel so depressed.&#x201d;<br>Often, Gail&#x2019;s solution was a night out. She pressed Amanda to go out dancing at a disco and meet guys. And sometimes Amanda said yes. One night they went to a dance club in Albany and the men noticed when they arrived. They were an arresting pair: Amanda, tall, slim and sexy with her Raquel Welch good looks and streaked long brown hair, and the smaller, exotic Gail who only came up to Amanda&#x2019;s shoulder. Amanda sat down with her drink and opened a book she&#x2019;d brought to the club, The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness by Erich Fromm. The book examined man&#x2019;s misdeeds&#x2014;especially murder and war&#x2014;and suggested that human beings were not innately evil but did evil things when their needs were frustrated and they were unable to achieve wholeness, happiness. While Gail performed on the dance floor, Amanda sipped her drink and watched her friend, dancing to a song by Gail&#x2019;s favorite group, Supertramp.<br>Amanda returned to her book. She was fascinated by Fromm&#x2019;s idea that evil people were created by thwarted hopes. Turning a page, brushing her long, brown hair aside, Amanda looked up to see a darkly handsome guy with black hair and a mustache smiling at her.<br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; he said to her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Nick.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; thought Amanda. &#x201c;Here comes Disco Joe. At least he&#x2019;s good-looking.&#x201d; But Nick was no dummy. He began talking intelligently about the Fromm book and other subjects. He and Amanda hit it off right away. It turned out *Nick Edwards was a plastic surgery resident at the local hospital. A surprised Gail returned from the dance floor to find that Amanda&#x2014;without even trying&#x2014;had found a doctor. Nick was there with another resident and he and Gail began talking. Gail and the other physician never quite clicked and she later broke up with her boyfriend Phil. But Amanda and Nick fell in love and moved in together. A few years later, in 1979, Amanda lived Gail&#x2019;s dream&#x2014;she married her doctor.<br>It was in that same year, 1979, that Gail whizzed uptown on her roller skates. She rolled over the dirty sidewalks and gutters and around pedestrians and cars on her way to her latest boyfriend *Ken Dahlberg&#x2019;s office. After seeing Ken, Gail planned to skate in Central Park. She loved the park, enjoyed skating or walking its shady paths, sunning herself in a bathing suit, meeting people. She felt Ken treated her badly. One week, Ken would act like they were getting married and then he would treat her like garbage. She and Ken had been fighting again and Gail stopped by to work things out.<br>When she arrived, Ken made it very clear that it was over. Gail stormed out of Ken&#x2019;s office and began skating toward the park. At first, she was angry and dejected. She did not have another boyfriend waiting in the wings.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in love with Ken, so why am I so disturbed?&#x201d; Gail asked herself.<br>His rebuff should not have had such a troubling effect on her. But it was the feeling of being rejected without any means to gain control that really got to Gail. She remembered all the other times it had happened and thought, &#x201c;Here we go again.&#x201d; She felt that it was never going to be any different.<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take this anymore,&#x201d; Gail decided.<br>She rolled to a halt. Standing still, she made a decision and her racing emotions faded away. Perfectly calm, Gail turned around and changed direction. She skated back toward her neighborhood. As her resolve strengthened, she skated faster. She remembered she had a bottle of vodka at home. &#x201c;If forty Quaaludes don&#x2019;t do the trick, the combination of both will,&#x201d; she decided.</p><h2>Homeopathic Mind Maps Remedies Animal Kingdom</h2><p>In three volumes Alicia lays out the remedies in a visual form that illustrates the unfolding nature of each remedy. The presentation gives a full view of the materia medica at a sweeping glance, and also allows the homeopath to easily follow the development from deepest mental beliefs to the resultant pathology in a flowing, logical pattern. Homeopathic mind maps are not a new idea, however, the form that Alicias mind maps follow is completely unique. It is a stream of consciousness, giving a multi-dimensional view of the remedies which we have never seen before. Whilst very complex for the author to create, they actually transform our view of the individual remedies into lovely simplicity. Whilst Alicias mind map books are written for homeopaths, and are exceptionally useful as teaching resources for materia medica, they are also of interest to the layman. Each book is enriched with history, chemistry, mythology, herbal lore, folklore, etymology, taxonomy and a wealth of other resources that enhance our understanding of the substance. Each mind map is brought to vividly expressive life with an apt photograph. The books are beautifully produced on high quality paper, in glorious colour and with a wire binding that allows the reader to double the book back on itself, making the book very simple to hold and taking up much less room on the desktop.

No, not the squeaky-voiced troubadour who tip-toed through tulips in the 1960s, but the original--Timothy Cratchit, the crutch-wielding tyke from Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. Only now he's a "mostly able-bodied" 23 years old, resides in a London whorehouse in exchange for tutoring the madam, struggles to wean himself from financial dependence on his ancient "Uncle" Ebenezer Scrooge, and, as we learn in Louis Bayard's darkly enchanting historical thriller, <i>Mr. Timothy</i>, is haunted by the spirit of his late father--a man whose optimism and strength the son feels himself incapable of imitating.<p> When we first encounter Timothy, during the Christmas season of 1860, he's vexed by the discovery of two dead 10-year-old girls, each branded with the letter "G"--one found in an alley, the other fished from the Thames River by Cratchit and a voluble old salt who makes his money by finding (and then robbing, of course) errant corpses. Timothy's concern leads him to protect a third possessively marked waif, the frightened and suspicious Philomela--who, he soon realizes, is being sought by a knife-loving former Scotland Yard inspector and a moneyed, malevolent voluptuary. When, despite precautions, Philomela is kidnapped by her pursuers, Cratchit--assisted by a shrewd warbling urchin known as Colin the Melodious--resolves to fulfill his "great calling" in life by mounting a rescue. However, this mission will force the habitually uncourageous Timothy to not only defend himself against sexual molestation charges, storm a well-guarded mansion, and solve the puzzle of a coffin-filled basement, but also engage in a nightmarish final chase along London's docklands.</p><p> Authors employing real-life characters as detectives are often hampered by their adherence to historical fact. Bayard suffers no such limitations in imagining what fates awaited Dickens's now-famous fictional figures. Under his pen, Scrooge--whose rooms are decorated for Christmas year-round--becomes an eccentric collector of fungi and host to an interminable stream of charity solicitors, while Timothy Cratchit strikes out beyond his lonely young man status to become the head of an unconventional clan. Bayard's appreciation for the lurid exoticness of Victorian London rivals that of John MacLachlan Gray (<i>The Fiend in Human</i>), while his lyrical prose subtly suggests 19th-century influences. <i>Mr. Timothy</i> is at once a compelling Christmas crime yarn and an audacious literary endeavor.

Rob and his neighbor Luther Wesley Vinson, a.k.a. Soup, are devotees of a radio show starring Sinker O. Sailor.

With 60 books to his credit, another success is no surprise.<br><i> Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 2-5. This latest Soup adventure follows the delightful pattern of the previous ones. Soup and friend Rob enter a radio contest and win the coveted prize of a visit to their town by radio hero Sinker O. Sailor, who promises a live broadcast during his visit. As in previous books, Rob still falls for Soup's schemes and does whatever Soup bids, no matter how dangerous or embarrassing. The boys get into preposterous situations, linked just enough to reality to be hilarious. Set in a time when kids listened to the radio after school and rummaged in the local dump for parts for their projects, the story contains a few anachronisms. However, references to toxic waste and the use of cordless microphones will probably bother only the sharpest of readers. The fast-paced story is filled with puns and boasts all the old cast--heartthrob Norma Jean Bissell as well as bully Janice Riker.

Connie Kang tells the story of one of America's most recent, and successful, immigrant groups: the Korean-Americans.The author's tale is one of hardship, as wars twice force her family to flee their homes in Korea. It is also a story of heartbreak, as her new life in America, first as a student and then as a reporter, irreversibly separates her from her parents and their values. Ultimately, hers is a story of the lure of American freedom, and the wisdom offered up by a lifelong struggle to reconcile two vastly different cultures.Connie Kang, who came to the United States in 1961, interweaves her family's story with Korea's tempestuous recent history. Her grandfather, Myong-Hwan Kang, a nationalist organizer during the period of Japanese colonialism, is arrested and tortured for his activities. Only a few years after the victory over Japan, war breaks out with the Communists in the North. Connie and her mother escape on an all-night ride on top of a railroad car, and arrive as refugees in Pusam. Eventually they rejoin Connie's father in Tokyo, and then Okinawa.As a college student in America, the author meets other Korean students, and for the first time grapples with the question of her Korean identity. Though she is drawn to the personal freedom in America, her emotional ties to her family and country are equally strong, setting the stage for a conflict of identities which has yet to cease. She becomes one of the first Korean-American journalists in the U.S., but still her family breaks up her intended marriage to an American. When she tries living and working in Korea, she finds the role of women too restricted. Finally she decides to settle in America. Now, as a reporter, she covers the Asian-American communities around Los Angeles, helping to bring to light the issues that affect recent immigrants like herself.In a warm, sympathetic voice that is refreshingly candid but never sentimental, K. Connie Kang has written <i>the</i> book on the Korean-American experience. It is a story that will touch us all.</p><p><b>K.Connie Kang</b> was reared and educated in Korea, Japan, and the U.S. She is a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, specializing in Asian-American Affairs.In an unusually frank and vivid narrative, Los Angeles Times reporter and editor Kang chronicles her Korean-American family from the turn of the century to the present. Her grandfather, Myong-Hwan Kang, a resistance fighter against the Japanese occupation of Korea, was tortured and imprisoned twice by the Japanese, once in 1914 and again in 1919. At the outbreak of the Korean War, her family fled their ancestral home in North Korea, settling in Seoul, then Pusan and moving to Tokyo, where her father, Joo-Han Kang, an English teacher, was recruited to assist General Douglas MacArthur's command in the early 1950s. After an adolescence in Japan, the author studied at the University of Missouri in 1961, followed by Northwestern University. Then Kang moved back to Korea (1967-1970), marrying a white American Vietnam veteran against her parents' protests.The marriage fell apart in Baltimore when she refused to cut her ties to Korean ways. In the 1970s, as a reporter in San Francisco, she helped her family relocate and open a grocery store there. Writing with deep insight about Korea's tumultuous political history, her bicultural identity and the challenges facing Asian-Americans, Kang delivers a stirring, beautiful book.

She returns to the same location for <i>Blackberry Wine</i>. But as the title suggests, she's shifted her focus from food to drink, choosing a half-dozen bottles of homemade plonk as the catalyst for her "layman's alchemy." And even the narrator is no human being but a faintly tannic Fleurie 1962: "A pert, garrulous wine, cheery and little brash, with a pungent taste of blackcurrant!"<p> There are, of course, some less vinous characters in the novel. Harris's protagonist, Jay Mackintosh, is a former literary star, now sadly stalled. He spends his time writing second-rate science fiction, leading a hollow media life, and drinking: "Not to forget, but to remember, to open up the past and find himself there again." Yet the nice, expensive wines don't do the trick. Instead, six "Specials"--a gift from his old friend Joe--function as Jay's magical elixir. Like Proust's lime-blossom tisane, they give him the gift of his memories but also unlock his future, which encourages him to flee the rut of his London life and buy a house in Lansquenet. </p><p> As Jay settles in, he contemplates his childhood friendship with Joe, whose idiosyncratic outlook was the inspiration for his only successful book. Meanwhile, he becomes involved in village life, encountering some familiar faces from <i>Chocolat</i>. Caro and Toinette, the snooty troublemakers, soon put in an appearance, and Josephine, the bar owner and battered wife of the earlier novel, becomes a real friend. But it's a new character, the enigmatic Marise, who becomes the focus of Jay's attention--and who helps to restore his literary joie de vivre. This feat of resurrection makes for a hugely enjoyable read. It also goes one step further in adding Lansquenet to the map of imaginary destinations, where daydreams can come true with intoxicating frequency. <i>--Eithne Farry</i></p>From the author of <i>Chocolat</i>, an intoxicating fairy tale of alchemy and love where wine is the magic elixir. <br> <br>Jay Mackintosh is a 37-year-old has-been writer from London. Fourteen years have passed since his first novel, Jackapple Joe, won the Prix Goncourt. His only happiness comes from dreaming about the golden summers of his boyhood that he spent in the company of an eccentric vintner who was the inspiration of Jay's debut novel, but who one day mysteriously vanished. Under the strange effects of a bottle of Joe's '75 Special, Jay decides to purchase a derelict yet promising ch�teau in Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. There, a ghost from his past waits to confront him, and his new neighbour, the reclusive Marise - haunted, lovely and dangerous - hides a terrible secret behind her closed shutters. Between them, there seems to be a mysterious chemistry.

They made a remarkable discovery. The tomb contained several ossuaries, or bone boxes, two of which were carved with an iconic image and a Greek inscription. Taken together, the image and the inscription constitute the earliest archaeological evidence of faith in Jesus&#x2019; resurrection. <br><br>Since the newly discovered ossuaries can be reliably dated to before 70 AD, when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans, they also provide the first evidence in Jerusalem of the people who would later be called &#x201c;Christians.&#x201d; In fact, it is possible, maybe even likely, that whoever was buried in this tomb knew Jesus and heard him preach. <br><br>The newly examined tomb is only 200 feet away from the so-called Jesus Family Tomb. This controversial tomb, excavated in 1980 and recently brought to international attention, contained ossuaries inscribed with names associated with Jesus and his immediate family. Critics dismissed the synchronicity of names as mere coincidence. But the new discovery increases the likelihood that the &#x201c;Jesus Family Tomb&#x201d; is, indeed, the real tomb of Jesus of Nazareth. Tabor and Jacobovici discuss the evidence in support of this interpretation and describe how both tombs appear to have been part of the property of a wealthy individual, possibly Joseph of Arimathea, the man who, according to the gospels, buried Jesus. <br><br><i>The Jesus Discovery </i>explains how the recent find is revolutionizing our understanding of the earliest years of Christianity. Tabor and Jacobovici discuss what the concept of resurrection meant to the first followers of Jesus, particularly how it differed from the common understanding of the term today. Because the new archaeological discovery predates all other Christian documents, including the gospels, it offers a dramatic witness to what the people who knew Jesus believed. <br><br>There is no doubt that this is one of the most important archaeological discoveries ever made. <i>The Jesus Discovery </i>is the firsthand account of how it happened and what it means.</p><p><b>James D.

This discovery adds significantly to our understanding of Jesus, his earliest followers, and the birth of Christianity. In this book we reveal reliable archaeological evidence that is directly connected to Jesus&#x2019; first followers&#x2014;those who knew him personally&#x2014;and to Jesus himself. The discovery provides the earliest archaeological evidence of faith in Jesus&#x2019; resurrection from the dead, the first witness to a saying of Jesus that predates even the writing of our New Testament gospels, and the earliest example of Christian art&#x2014;all found in a sealed tomb dated to the 1st century CE.1<br> <br>We refer to this tomb as the Patio tomb, since it is now located beneath an apartment patio, eight feet under the basement of a condominium complex. Such juxtapositions of modernity and antiquity are not unusual in Jerusalem, where construction must often be halted to rescue and excavate tombs from ancient times. The Patio tomb was first uncovered by construction work in 1981 in East Talpiot, a suburb of Jerusalem less than two miles south of the Old City.<br> <br>Our discoveries also provide precious new evidence for evaluating the &#x201c;Jesus son of Joseph&#x201d; tomb, discovered a year earlier, which made international headlines in 2007.2 We refer to this 1980 tomb as the Garden tomb, since it is now situated beneath a garden area in the same condominium complex. These two tombs, both dating to around the time of Jesus, are less than two hundred feet apart. Together with a third tomb nearby that was unfortunately destroyed by the construction blasts, these tombs formed a cluster and most likely belonged to the same clan or extended family. Any interpretation of one tomb has to be made in the light of the other. As a result we believe a compelling argument can be made that the Garden tomb is that of Jesus of Nazareth and his family. We argue in this book that both tombs are most likely located on the rural estate of Joseph of Arimathea, the wealthy member of the Sanhedrin who according to all four New Testament gospels took official charge of Jesus&#x2019; burial.<br> <br>Who was Joseph of Arimathea and how did he enter the historical picture? The Jesus Discovery explores the answers to this and a series of related questions. The recent discoveries in the Patio tomb put the controversy about the Jesus family tomb in new light. We now have new archaeological evidence, literally written in stone, that can guide us in properly understanding what Jesus&#x2019; earliest followers meant by their faith in Jesus&#x2019; resurrection from the dead&#x2014;with his earthly remains, and those of his family, peacefully interred just yards away. This might sound like a contradiction, but only because certain theological traditions regarding the meaning of resurrection of the dead have clouded our understanding of what Jesus and his first followers truly believed. When we put together the texts of the gospels with this archaeological evidence, the results are strikingly consistent and stand up to rigorous standards of historical evidence.<br> <br>Accessing the sealed Patio tomb was a tremendous challenge. The technological challenge alone was daunting. Our only access to this tomb was through a series of eight-inch drill holes in the basement floor of the condominium. We were not even positive these probes would open into the tomb. We literally had only inches to spare. Investigating the tomb required getting agreements from the owners of the building over the tomb; the Israel Antiquities Authority, which controls permission to carry out any archaeological work in Israel; the Jerusalem police, whose task is to keep the peace and avoid incitements to riot; and the Heredim, the ultra-Orthodox authorities whose mission is to protect all Jewish tombs, ancient or modern, from any kind of disturbance. None of these parties had any particular motivation to assist us and for various reasons they disagreed with one another about their own interests. Any one of them could have stopped us at any point along the way, and there were many anxious times when we thought the exploration would never happen. Ultimately we were able to persuade each group to support the excavation. That we succeeded at all is more than a minor miracle. At the same time we had no evidence that our exploration of this tomb, if it were possible, would yield anything of importance. But we both agreed it was a gamble worth taking.<br> <br>At many points the entire operation seemed likely to collapse. We pushed on, however, not because we knew what was inside the tomb, but because we could not bear the thought of never knowing. Since that time we have begun to put the entire story together and a coherent picture is emerging that offers a new understanding of Jesus and his earliest followers in the first decades of the movement.<br> <br>Archaeologists who work on the history of ancient Judaism and early Christianity disagree over whether there is any reliable archaeological evidence directly related to Jesus or his early followers.3 Most are convinced that nothing of this sort has survived&#x2014;not a single site, inscription, artifact, drawing, or text mentioning Jesus or his followers, or witnessing to the beliefs of the earliest Jewish Christians either in Jerusalem or in Galilee.<br> <br>Jesus was born, lived, and died in the land of Israel. Most scholars agree he was born around 5 BCE and died around 30 CE. We have abundant archaeological evidence from this period related to Galilee, where he began his preaching and healing campaigns, and Jerusalem, where he was crucified. There is evidence related to Herod Antipas, the high priest Caiaphas, and even Pontius Pilate, who had him crucified, but nothing that would connect us to Jesus himself, or even to his earliest followers&#x2014;until now. Our hope is that these exciting new discoveries can become the catalyst for reconsidering other archaeological evidence that might well be related to the first Jewish-Christian believers.<br> <br>The oldest copies of the New Testament gospels date to the early 4th century CE&#x2014;well over two hundred years after Jesus&#x2019; lifetime. There are a few papyri fragments of New Testament writings that scholars have dated to the 2nd century CE, but nothing so far in the 1st century. The earliest Christian art is found in the catacomb tombs in Rome, dating to the late 2nd or early 3rd centuries CE. Our discovery effectively pushes back the date on early Christian archaeological evidence by two hundred years. More significantly, it takes us back into the lifetime of Jesus himself.<br> <br>This has been the most extraordinary adventure of our careers, and we are pleased to be able to share with readers the surprising and profound story of The Jesus Discovery.<br> <br>James D.

In addition, he wrote the screenplay to THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, starring Sean Connery, and created the acclaimed young readers comic series LEAVE IT TO CHANCE.The second collection of the 1990s Starman comic shows the creators hitting their stride, establishing elements that would become hallmarks of the series: reluctant young hero Jack Knight&#x2019;s growing confidence in the role of Starman he inherited from his father, flashbacks to 1940s adventures of his predecessor, and stories incorporating the various other superheroes who have operated under the Starman rubric. While the groundbreaking Watchmen (1986) opened the door earlier to other superhero tales set in a world recognizably our own, Starman eschewed that series&#x2019; knowing cynicism in favor of the moving coming-of-age story of an idealistic young man learning how to be a hero.</p><h2>Extreme Word The Extreme Word For Young Adults (ages 18-30)</h2><p><p>Everything you've loved about the <i> Extreme Teen Bible</i> is now available for those who are ready to take an extreme stand for Jesus in the adult world. <i>Extreme Word</i> will help young adults (ages 18-30) to live their lives according to the truth of the Bible and address the tough issues of life-from finding the right job to knowing God's will about marriage, from transitioning relationships with parents to dealing with workplace injustices. <i>Extreme Word</i> has all the same edgy features as the <i> Extreme Teen Bible</i>: 66 book introductions, 100+ promises from God's Word, hundreds of factual notes making difficult passages clear, over 250 On the Edge devotions, and 40 full-page Bible bios of young people who lived for God.</p></p><p><i>Extreme Word</i> is like a friendly youth-group leader, helping teenagers develop a conservative yet highly personal relationship with Christianity and the Bible.

The former owner of the&nbsp;&nbsp;statue was Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.

Her family moved to Pennsylvania when she was young, and most of her childhood was spent in small towns in that state. When she attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, she majored in chemistry, and after graduation she worked as a chemist, doing research and teaching. It wasn't until after she was married and had three children in school that Konigsburg began writing books.<br>&nbsp;<br>What is exceptional about Konigsburg is her ability to communicate convincingly from the point of view of a child. As the reviewer for <i>The Horn Book</i> said of <i>Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth,</i> "The story is full...of situations completely in tune with the imaginations of ten-year-old girls."

Our house, constructed of wood timber and roofed with asphalt shingles, straddles the boundary where the wasteland and the northernmost edge of the Western Population Corridor meet. This land was once my great-grandfather&#x2019;s farm. Once was. Hasn&#x2019;t been for a long time.<br> <br>Every morning, my brother and I rise before dawn, make the trek to the mag-station, and ride into the Corridor to attend school, where we plug into the etherstream via the chip in our forearm. By law, our chip-traces can&#x2019;t display any information about race, religion, or sexual orientation, but our classmates have always known that Paul and I are Others, of aboriginal descent, marked by the precious Plague antibodies in our blood.<br> <br>Every afternoon, we make the return trip, riding the mag-train to the end of its line before walking back home along the old dirt road. Behind us, smog from the Corridor reaches north, stretching its ugly yellow fingers as far as it can as it tries to snatch up the last of the habitable land. Not long ago, a reserve was here, lodged in the Corridor&#x2019;s throat, but all that remains now is our home. We are the only ones who have stayed, clinging to what little is ours, defiantly living as we always have, without computers and etherstreams and data-nets in our home, without food gels, without central heat. This is our choice. This is what it means to live the Old Way.<br> <br>Today the walk seems longer than usual, because Paul isn&#x2019;t talking to me. He got into a fight earlier in the day, but it&#x2019;s not his split lip or his gashed knuckles that have me so worried. Paul&#x2019;s on disciplinary action for fighting and truancy as it is, which is tough on both of us. Why can&#x2019;t you be more like your sister? the teachers always say to him. Why can&#x2019;t you help your brother? they say to me. We&#x2019;re twins, Paul and me, but we&#x2019;re not alike&#x2014;not anymore, at least. Paul&#x2019;s always had a short fuse, but lately it&#x2019;s gotten shorter.<br> <br>Now he walks beside me, slump-shouldered as his battered raven flies next to him. The raven is Paul&#x2019;s shade, his spirit animal, and it always shows up after something bad happens to him. Today it was some kid who was looking for a scapegoat to blame for his brother dying of Plague. The rest who joined in? Well, no one in the Corridor needs an excuse to stick it to an Other.<br> <br>Paul notices me watching him. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; he asks as his shade casts him in the wavering light where spirit and flesh merge. The raven looks as beaten and bruised as Paul.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your raven. He&#x2019;s back.&#x201d;<br> <br>Paul glances over his shoulder, but there&#x2019;s nothing there for him to see. Only I can see the shades, even though I don&#x2019;t seem to have one of my own. Paul&#x2019;s gifts run a different path. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he says with a sigh, &#x201c;at least it&#x2019;s here and not at school.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;s right. When shades come to me, they sometimes take me under into the twilight world of spirit. More than once, I&#x2019;ve been trapped there, unable to find my way back to my body. I fear that one day I&#x2019;ll drown in the heavy darkness of the other side. But not today. Today I watch Paul&#x2019;s raven and worry, for there&#x2019;s one thing I know: When a shade comes to visit, something is about to change.<br> <br>We round the last corner of the road, and the moment our house comes into view, Paul&#x2019;s raven takes flight, leaving my brother lighter, unfettered. Paul may not like it here, but this place is good for him. Under the watchful eyes of the old windows, my brother is whole. He races inside to change out of his school clothes, the old floorboards creaking under his movements. It&#x2019;s not long before he pounds back downstairs and flies through the kitchen, grabbing the last biscuit from breakfast before disappearing outside.<br> <br>I always leave the last one for him.<br> <br>I wait until I hear the sound of Paul&#x2019;s ax striking wood before I go inside and close the door, leaning against it to seal the Corridor, school, the Band, the entire world outside. We have made it through another day. Our family is still together, if not whole.<br> <br>For one complete minute, I allow myself to pretend we&#x2019;re safe. The minute ends, as it always does, and reality sets in. Time for chores, but first I need to hide the contraband in my schoolbag: twine, twigs, old pencils, paper clips, elastic bands, tossed-away shirts, a red ribbon, a bundle of rusted keys. The family magpie, my father calls me. He doesn&#x2019;t like that I take castaway items hiding in the school basement or in the lost-and-found, forgotten, homeless. No one may want them, but it&#x2019;s still stealing, he says.<br> <br>I do it anyhow. One day I might need an elastic, or a scrap of leather, or a length of wire. That&#x2019;s what I tell myself, but most of these things, ancient and obsolete, will end up in a weaving, or a basket, or a dream catcher for Paul. This is how I pass my time when the night falls and we&#x2019;re left in the dark, because I don&#x2019;t need to see to work with my hands. I need only to feel.<br> <br>The twine and paper clips and the other cast-off junk spill onto the table the moment I unbuckle my school bag. Sunlight glints off the keys, and for a moment they seem to wriggle like bright blue herring, a fresh catch, ready to be devoured.<br> <br>I blink and they are keys again.<br> <br>The Old Way is a way of work. We have no electricity, no running water, no garbage collection. Our luxuries are born of our own hands. The Old Way keeps us honest, my father says. It keeps us connected to the earth.<br> <br>That doesn&#x2019;t stop me from thinking about a day, a week, a lifetime in the Corridor. Even with the rolling blackouts, they have heat in the dead of our brutal winter. Their bones don&#x2019;t ache when the rains come, nor do they have to haul in wood when squalls descend from the north, blanketing the world with snow&#x2014;not to mention it&#x2019;s a lot easier to hide from the searchers among the millions in the Corridor. Here, we&#x2019;re exposed, and there&#x2019;s not much stopping them from coming to gobble us up.<br> <br>In the Corridor I would find a job, and with the money I earned, I would buy my father a new armchair so he had somewhere comfortable to sit after a hard day of work. I would buy myself a new wool coat and a pair of boots to keep my feet warm in the winter.<br> <br>And for my brother?<br> <br>For Paul, I would buy peace of mind and freedom from the dead, except that&#x2019;s not for sale in the Corridor. That&#x2019;s not for sale anywhere.<br> <br>But we don&#x2019;t live in the Corridor. We live here, on this farm, with its aging roof, its slumping porch, its sorry, sorry garden that I go outside to tend. Paul and my father have no talent for coaxing food from the depleted soil, so the task is left to me. I weed, I till, I plant, I nurture, and if I am lucky, the earth rewards me with a meager bounty in the fall: some squash. Apples, if the spring was warm enough for bees. Turnips, cabbage&#x2014;there&#x2019;s always enough of those. But not like the old days, when this land was among the richest on earth. The rivers ran so thick with fish a man could walk from one shore to the other without ever getting his feet wet, they say. Bears gorged themselves on berries until they were food-drunk. Sweet rain fell like manna from heaven.<br> <br>Now our squash vines are stained with white mildew. Tomatoes won&#x2019;t grow. Potatoes do, sometimes, if blight doesn&#x2019;t get them first. But still, we stay. This is our land. This is home.<br> <br>Our father refuses to supplement our diet with nourishment gels. Only whole food, real food for us, he says. The UA-distributed stuff will rot our guts, rot our souls.<br> <br>I agree with him on that, at least.<br> <br>Our father returns home after dark. The table is set, dinner made, the fire stoked even though it&#x2019;s the beginning of June. The chill stays later and later each year as the earth dies her slow death.<br> <br>Paul gobbles down his dinner while our father washes the ash and dirt from the plastics refinery off his body. This is a clever ploy on Paul&#x2019;s part, because if he&#x2019;s not here, my father can&#x2019;t ask him about the swollen eye that Paul still won&#x2019;t talk about.<br> <br>I spoon stew onto my father&#x2019;s plate and then my own, sitting down at the table, ignoring Paul&#x2019;s empty spot. The stew was Paul&#x2019;s idea. I wanted to make soup, which isn&#x2019;t as filling but stretches the food remaining from last year&#x2019;s harvest further. We argued about this earlier, and in the end, Paul won out. As my father sops up the thick, heavy stew with a piece of biscuit, I can&#x2019;t help feeling that Paul was right and I was wrong. My need to be thrifty, to dole out our lives in careful measures, would have prevented my father from enjoying tonight&#x2019;s dinner, and goodness knows my father can use every little bit of enjoyment he gets.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have good news,&#x201d; my father says as he chews. &#x201c;I might be up for a raise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great, Dad,&#x201d; I whisper. I refuse to look at him. He is an unabashed romantic, my father, always holding on to hope, whistling that song about the bright side of life despite the fact that sunlight is a murderer and poison rain her accomplice.<br> <br>A hand reaches out to take mine, and I resist the temptation to flinch. It&#x2019;s covered with sores and burns. It couldn&#x2019;t possibly belong to my father. &#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;ll be enough money to take a vacation,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Just you and Paul and me. Somewhere nice. What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the best response I summon up, because it&#x2019;s only a matter of time until my father&#x2019;s position at the plastics refinery is rendered obsolete. They don&#x2019;t know he&#x2019;s an Other. I&#x2019;m not sure how he&#x2019;s concealed it, but he has. Sooner or later someone will catch on, and my father will be entered into the UA inventory too. Either that or a machine will replace him.<br> <br>It could be worse, I suppose. It could always be worse.<br> <br>Later, long after my father has fallen asleep, I creep through the dark, searching for Paul. Our house was built back in the days when fertility rates were still high. It has four bedrooms. Mine is at the back, overlooking the garden. My father sleeps on the old, threadbare sofa downstairs, and Paul? Well, Paul has always been a wanderer. I never know where I&#x2019;ll find him.<br> <br>His voice drifts out from what was once my parents&#x2019; bedroom. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in here. Put out the candle and come look at the stars.&#x201d;<br> <br>I take a seat beside him on the windowsill and stare at the sky, stained gray by the Corridor lights. &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t much to see. Too much smoke.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, look. There&#x2019;s Orion&#x2019;s Belt.&#x201d; He points. &#x201c;Mintaka, Alnilam, Alnitak.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, I see them.&#x201d; But I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;not really.<br> <br>But then the clouds shift and a few stars appear, along with the half-full moon. Her thin light illuminates Paul&#x2019;s face. Our faces share the same sharp planes, Paul and me. Both of us have hair the color of dark honey. Our teeth are white and straight, a reminder of what our father has sacrificed for us. Our father&#x2019;s teeth are brown around the edges now, and sometimes I see him spitting blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad&#x2019;s talking about a raise again,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;About time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know he won&#x2019;t get it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Paul turns. His eyes are dark and I see a raven&#x2019;s wing drift through them. &#x201c;You would have to say something like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s got to be the voice of reason in this family.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Naysayer, you mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Truthsayer.&#x201d; I toy with the hem of my nightgown and shiver, suddenly cold. &#x201c;But no one ever listens.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t want to leave my brother here alone, but unlike him, I&#x2019;m no good without sleep. So I rise and creep to the door, but when I turn to say good night, Paul&#x2019;s already forgotten about me. His eyes are fixed on the night sky. His head is tipped to one side, as if he&#x2019;s listening to something only he can hear, and I wonder&#x2014;not for the first time&#x2014;if the stars talk to Paul. He&#x2019;s never mentioned it. I&#x2019;ve never asked, but what I do know is that when my brother&#x2019;s like this, deep in communion with something I&#x2019;ll never hear or see, I worry for him&#x2014;even more than when I see his raven, because when Paul enters that world, he does so alone.<br> <br>And one day I fear he might not come back.</p><h2>Scooby-doo And The Phantom Cowboy</h2><p>Scooby-Doo is an 'Ameri-canine' icon, the most beloved cartoon pooch of the past three generations.

Included among these written materials and objects are letters, signatures, journals, baskets, pictographs, confessions, wills, and petitions, each of which represents a form of authorship. Together they demonstrate the continuing use of traditional forms of memory and communication and the lively engagement of Native peoples with alphabetic literacy during the colonial period. Each primary text is accompanied by an essay that places it in context and explores its significance. Written by leading scholars in the field, these readings draw on recent trends in literary analysis, history, and anthropology to provide an excellent overview of the field of early Native studies. They are also intended to provoke discussion and open avenues for further exploration by students and other interested readers. Above all, the texts and commentaries gathered in this volume provide an opportunity to see Native American literature as a continuity of expression that reflects choices made long before contact and colonization, rather than as a nineteenth&#x2015;or even twentieth-century invention.Contributors include Heidi Bohaker, Heather Bouwman, Joanna Brooks, Kristina Bross, Stephanie Fitzgerald, Sandra Gustafson, Laura Arnold Leibman, Kevin McBride, David Murray, Laura Murray, Jean O'Brien, Ann Marie Plane, Philip Round, Jodi Schorb, David Silverman, and Hilary E.

He lives in New York.High Cotton<br>1 /T<i>he</i> N<i>ew</i> N<i>egro</i>No one sat me down and told me I was a Negro. That was something I figured out on the sly, late in my childhood career as a snoop, like discovering that babies didn't come from an exchange of spinach during a kiss. The great thing about finding out I was a Negro was that I could look forward to going places in the by and by that I would not have been asked to as a white boy.There was nothing to be afraid of as long as we were polite and made good grades. After all, the future, back then, assembled as we were on the glossy edge of the New Frontier, belonged to us, the Also Chosen. The future was something my parents were either earning or keeping for my two sisters and me, like the token checks that came on birthdays from grandparents, great-uncles, great-aunts.The future was put away for us, the way dark blue blazers were put away until we could grow into them, the way meatloaf was wrapped up for the next nervous quiz meal and answers to our stormy looks were stored up for that tremendous tomorrow. Every scrap of the future mattered, but I didn't have to worry my breezy head about it because someone was seeing to thingsand had been ever since my great-grandfather's grandmother stepped on the auction block.All men were created equal, but even so, lots of mixed messages with sharp teeth waited under my Roy Rogers pillow. You were just as good as anyone else out there, but they--whoever "they" were--had rigged things so that you had to be close to perfect just to break even. You had nothing to fear, though every time you left the house for a Spelling Bee or a Music Memory Contest the future of the future hung in the balance. You were not an immigrant, there were no foreign accents, weird holidays, or funny foods to live down, but still you did not belong to the great beyond out there; yet though you did not belong it was your duty as the Also Chosen to get up and act as though you belonged, especially when no one wanted you to.You had nothing to be ashamed of, though some of the Also Chosen talked in public at the top of their lungs, said "Can I get" instead of "May I have," and didn't say "please" ever. United we stood, which did not include everyone on the block. It wasn't right to think you were better than your neighbor, but it also wasn't smart to want to be like the kids who ran up and down the alley all day and were going to end up on a bad corner in front of a record shop dancing under the phonograph speaker strapped above the door.Forgiveness was divine, but people who moved away from you at the movies, tried to short-change you at the new shopping mall, or didn't want you to have a table at the Indianapolis Airport restaurant would get what was coming to them, though they acted that way because they didn't know any better. All you had to do was ignore them, pretend you hadn't heard. Those who dwelled in the great beyond out there could not stop His truth from marching on, but until His truth made it as far as restricted Broadripple Park, you did not go swimming, because even thewading pool at Douglas Park had something floating in it that put your mother off. Douglas Park was not much fun. There were no train engines to climb over, no hand-carved carousels. The YMCA that met there let its beginning swimmers splash naked. Your father could step around whatever turned up in the water as often as he liked, but if you and your sisters got sick from swallowing something other than chlorine your mother was going to go back to her mother in Atlanta and never speak to your father again.To know where you were going, you had to know where you'd come from, though the claims that the past had on you were like cold hands in the dark. Those elderly relatives, old-timers in charcoal-gray suits and spinsters in musty fox tails, who went out of their way to come to Indianapolis to have a look at you, those wizards licking gold fillings and widows coughing on their bifocals whom you didn't want to travel miles and miles or eat ice cream with--they were among the many pearly reasons you had to hold your Vaselined head high, though you were never to mention in company your father's Uncle Ralph Waldo, who had lived the blues so well that he wound up in a nuthouse without the sense he was born with because of a disease. Grandfather Eustace spelled its name so fast not even your sisters were able to catch the letters.Above all, you had to remember that no one not family was ever going to love you really. The Also Chosen were one big happy family, though the elderly relatives who hung over holidays like giant helium balloons couldn't stand the sight of one another, which gave fuel to the blue flame of confidences and bitter fine points that burned until the stars folded up. Sometimes the old-timers seemed to be all there was. They far outnumbered their younger relatives. The family tapered off, depopulated itself from shelf to shelf, but the ranks of the old-timers promised neverto thin. They enlisted the departed in their number, on their side, which added to their collective power to dominate those of you who would never know what they knew.The old-timers boasted of their ability to bug you from the grave, saying one day you'd want to talk to them and they wouldn't be there anymore. They'd hint that they'd be watching you closely from wherever they went when they passed on. Your dearest reminded you every morning of the problem that you would never, never get away from. However, escape I did, the burden of consciousness was lifted from my round little shoulders, and for a while there I was gorgeously out of it.&nbsp;<br>Grandfather Eustace was the emperor of out-of-it, yet he was also a distinguished man who tried, in his way, to answer all the questions. Even before I was old enough to listen he was crouched in the prompter's box, anxious to pass on that record of alienated majesty. I spent much of my life running from him, centripetal fashion, because he was, to me, just a poor old darky. I did not return his phone calls, I cashed in his train tickets, I went to the movies when he came to visit, but he was forever rising through the waves of my denial, sustained by the knowledge that he, his father and mother before him, his brothers and sisters, his sons and daughters, were a sort of dusky peerage with their degrees, professions, and good marriages among their own kind."Your grandfather," my father once said, "suffered from being black at a time when everyone was white." Grandfather Eustace never let us forget that he had been educated in the Holy Land: at Brown and Harvard. He was a terrible snob, his pride somehow outrageous and shaky at the same time. He had a finely developed idea of his own worth and enjoyed, like ill health, the suspicion that no one else shared it. He took the high road, but because he made the journey in a black body he lived with the chronic dread that maybe he wasn't good enough.Grandfather acted out his contradictions in high-handed style. One of his brothers with whom he carried on a lifelong feud pointed out that before Grandfather became a minister he failed to hold on to the simplest clerk's job because he could never get along with his superiors or co-workers. Even after he became a man of the cloth more than one quiet church went to extraordinary lengths to rid itself of the "dicty spade" who wore his learning on his sleeve and pitched his sermons over the heads of the supplicants.Yet it was for their sakes that he was called to God. He loved to be among what he called the honest folk and preferred to be the only emissary from the Talented Tenth--Du Bois's elect, whose education was to be like a beacon to the unwashed. Believing that they looked up to him, Grandfather was consumed by a passion for the poor, the forgotten. His vocation revealed itself one twilight during the Depression when he found himself wandering through Yamacraw, the red-light district that clung by its fingernails to the rib cage of railroad in Savannah, Georgia. Yamacraw was so violent that the police never crossed the tracks.Surrounded by fired-up types, Grandfather began to bother their heads with visions of his own. The sons of Belial calmed down, and in a delirium of relief Grandfather talked on and sang and lamented. Hardly anyone followed what he said, but it sounded like the gospel truth because the theatrical, sorrowful young crackpot who stood before them with his arms stretched toward the rain clouds was touched with such a command of the language of the other side. He wasn't drunk and he didn't pass the hat, which proved that he was a cut above the usual jackleg Bible thumpers who cried out every Saturday night. Yamacraw carried him, the man they themselves might have been, into tin-roof shacks and fed him turnip greens. When they grew restless with his hootch-free eloquence, the messenger accepted an escort back to the fringes of decent Savannah. They left him serene inthe flivver dust, in the middle of a digression on Pascal's wager.Grandfather never got over the admiration in those faces, the rapt attention, the melancholy shadows thrown by the dented kerosene lamps. He also never again preached like that, but the Word meanwhile had become flesh.&nbsp;<br>Grandfather couldn't help himself. Whenever he opened the door he was on a mission to prove that the world didn't know whom it was dealing with. He came from the Old Country. Not Lithuania, not Silesia. The Old Country, to us, meant Virginia, Georgia, the Carolinas, spectral mileposts of cane swamp and pine, remote tidewater counties swollen with menacing lore. He was born in 1898, in "the quarters" on a farm near Dublin, Georgia. Sherman's march to the sea had left former slaves and masters together, ruined and forlorn. Decades later, devastation lingered over the region like a corrosive fume.Grandfather considered it good form not to talk to us about the hardships he had witnessed, just as his grandfather had thought it wise not to speak too truthfully about his years in bondage. Instead, Grandfather told of stealing melons as a boy. He remembered, for me, the sweetness of the dropping peaches, walking behind the plowmen and their mules, fishing in the silvery creeks, the scent of scrub oak, of turpentine stills, the thrill of hearing at night the consoling songs of toil and deliverance. No more auction block for me.Grandfather's real story, the one he never told, began, as they say, earlier than he. Perhaps his ancestors lived on the savannahs of Benin; no one knows. They were lost to us in the aorta of history. Certainly his forebears endured the voyage known as the Middle Passage. They were dragged from Africa to Charleston, South Carolina, to the potentates of mercantilism, in coffles aboard ships with names gratifying to their captains--<i>Swan, Hannibal, Temperance, Desire</i>. Grandfather liked to say that hisfamily had arrived before the Pilgrims, but after that he gave no more thought to them than he did to stuffed mammals in a children's museum. He, too, knew the famous paradox that a slave could be punished for a crime, but an ox could not commit one."Is it possible that any of my slaves could go to heaven and I must meet them there?"Grandfather's grandfather Limus remembered Crescent Plantation and the legendary occult practices of the pagan, Old Bess, who was his grandmother--maybe. "Old Bess pretends to be mad and works not." Limus was something of a blacksmith, more of a farmer, and every inch of the way a true believer. Limus, born a slave and buried "free," belonged, in Grandfather's mind, to that strange, unsalvageable land of smallpox and murder, of hot hours over slow-burning kilns, palmetto brooms, bunched guinea corn, rice fields. Grandfather had Limus saying at the age of eighty in 1905, "The family was always kind and considerate of its slaves."Grandfather's father, born in a new black town, Promised Land, South Carolina, the year the freedmen were enfranchised, was called Esau or "Free," the most common nickname of the period. Limus was against Esau's leaving the land. "You have no need that anyone should teach you." But a bush said his name and, spreading the Word like chicken feed, Esau set off for the Atlanta Baptist Seminary, an enthusiastic college for black men that began in a church basement. Esau took with him little but the name of the English planter family, those Carolinians--what were they to him?--who'd signed the Constitution, made speeches on the desertion of slaves, negotiated with Talleyrand, twice failed to win the Presidency, and boasted of not using nets as protection against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, because to these failed Presidents nets were effeminate.It was said that Esau sold berries to raise money, and if notberries something for nickels and dimes. The Atlanta Baptist Seminary was embraced, he fretted over the character of his namesake in the Bible, and when he was ordained who was there? Hannah Lloyd, a student at the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary across the road, one of the little earnest pioneers cloistered and finished for the future of the race. With Esau their future of rectitude was not far from home.They were married outdoors, on what had been a drill ground for Union troops, and then assigned to the missionary field in southern Georgia, a large territory that included part of the nasty tarheel of Florida. Grandfather's mother, "Pass Me Not Hannah," they called her, daughter of the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary, was something of an heiress, so they said, so Grandfather liked to say--a thousand acres and silver spoons to ladle the gravy even after the price of cotton fell.&nbsp;<br>Hannah's Seminole blood made her quick-tempered, they said, and she was strict with her five boys and merciless with her three daughters. She called on the saints to strengthen her paddle, "the household persuader," against sass and shiftlessness. Grandfather and his brothers were good swimmers, but the local hole was declared off-limits because Hannah feared that the boys who went there, black and white, would expose her sons to disease and bad grammar. They learned to keep to themselves on their paved street, or to play in abandoned "big houses" overgrown with Mar�chal Niel roses.Esau settled down as pastor of the Thankful Baptist Church in Augusta, Georgia, in 1912. The poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar went on Hannah's Index, as did tunes like "Under the Bamboo Tree," and to dance was to taste the apple, though she was pleased to claim W. C. Handy as her husband's friend. Instead of these pleasures, there were the glories of George Lofton's<i>Biblical Thoughts and Themes for Young Men and Women</i>, many histories of Jesus, illustrated Scripture galleries, Tennyson, and W.E.B. Du Bois, whose every utterance was taken as an addition to the King James Version.Nothing unpleasant ever broke through the narcotic of Grandfather's nostalgia, though the traditional horrors actually happened. What now seems tired was then fresh. Esau came home wet with whiskey after some provincials, the parlor word for crackers, ordered him to drink and shuffle, and backed up their threats by shooting at his feet. One night Esau hid under the floorboards of a forsaken country church while the necktie party that had elected him honored guest of the hickory tree raged over the benches. Grandfather hoarded these memories. Those that he handed out freely, the gentle yarns improvised during sermons and radio talks, gave him a satisfaction not unlike watching someone who has power of attorney sift through a shoebox of Confederate dol...</p><h2>Hearts Divided: An Anthology</h2><p>Hearts Divided by Debbie Macomber\Katherine Stone\Lois Faye Dyer released on Jan 31, 2006 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Grandmothers know best...especially these three grandmothers, all soldiers' brides.

With these stories -- sometimes heart-felt, sometimes brutal, always wildly entertaining -- Ethan Coen delivers everything you would expect from such an original imagination.</p><p>Even if it didn't contain a chomped ear and a decapitated head, Ethan Coen's debut fiction collection would resemble the horrifically giggly crime films of the Coen brothers (<i>Fargo</i>, etc.). You've got the bleakly realistic Midwest settings: a frazzled dad driven crazy driving his kids on a camping trip in "The Boys." You've got the minutia of the middle-class life captured down to the last speck of "abstractly speckled linoleum" ("The Old Country"). You've got comically incompetent thugs (Mafiosi spectacularly failing to bring Mob rule to Minneapolis in "Cosa Minapolidan," a college-boy boxer turned private dick in "Destiny"). You've got ghastly, amusing caricatures of showbiz moguls: the record-company guy soliloquizing in "Have You Ever Been to Electric Ladyland" could be as real as his allusions to the personal foibles of Cat Stevens and Danny Thomas. Above all, you've got a mockingly self-conscious yet vibrantly original style of pulp-culture homage and spoofy, sharp, vulgar dialogue like nobody else on earth can write, except Joel Coen (who cowrites movies with brother Ethan).<p> In print, Coen can show off a descriptive gift that can't fit into screenplays. His fiction is bright and never boring, but not ambitious--it lacks the obbligato of grim mystery and lyricism that throbs in some of his films. It's on the light side--more like <i>Raising Arizona</i> than <i>Miller's Crossing</i>. It's also the most penetrating glimpse into a Coen brother's mystery-crammed skull since the revealing <i>The Big Lebowski: The Making of a Coen Brothers Film</i>. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"Often funny, sometimes disturbing. . . Mr. Coen has sounded the jagged dissonance of the American experience."<br>--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"In <b>Gates of Eden</b>, the co-creator of such films as <i>Fargo</i> and <i>Blood Simple</i> delivers blackly humorous and often unsettling vignettes. . . .All the Coen brothers trademarks are here. . . funny. . .compelling stories."<br>--<i>USA Today</i><br><br>"A distinctive voice and an offbeat worldview. . .

Conclusion: Author Bio Publisher Introduction: People at large are fed up with the water, gas, electricity, sewer and many other bills that knock on their doors month after month without any break or relief. Everyone wants to get rid of such a lifestyle where you are dependent on these artificial things to survive. In many instances, people become so addicted and dependent on them that it becomes difficult and sometimes even impossible to survive without them. People spend all their lives working hard to earn a decent living and income, but the utility bills drain most of these hard earned funds. What if there was a way they could get out of this routine of bill payments and frustration. Going &#x201c;Off the Grid&#x201d; is the answer to such problems. All you have to do is produce your own resources and energy. This is why more and more people are turning towards this greener and environment-friendly way of living. The phenomenon of living with less is something that is everyone seeks. The idea of living with less has been described by Thoreau in Walden. Human lives have become very artificial and technical. There are a number of manmade technologies that we are now dependent upon. In many cases, our survival has become impossible without the presence of these human technologies. Our lives have become robotic like science fiction movies. There is a gadget for every activity and function. There are times in everyone&#x2019;s lives where we want to have a reprieve from these gadgets and technological wonders. This is when people rush towards the great wilderness and outdoors where the living is still natural and untouched by human evolution. You do not rely on utility services and manmade resources out in nature. There are many people in the world who want adopt this way of living in the natural habitat for their entire lives. They want to abandon the urban lifestyle and artificial way of living and move to the wilderness to have a close encounter with the natural resources and habitats of the world. As per the statistics of various official sources, in the United States alone, more than 200,000 people are adopting this way of living in natural conditions. It is also known as &#x201c;Off the Grid Living&#x201d; lifestyle. They have said goodbye and farewell to community municipal services and have decided to face the challenges that are accompanied from this freedom from various types of utility services.</p><p></p><h2>CIVIL WARS: WOMEN AND THE CRISIS OF SOUTHERN NATIONALISM (Women in American History)</h2><p>Three Library stamps, Very slight signs of age or use. 1991, 6 By 9&#34;, Weaves quotes from women&#39;s diaries into known Civil War Social history.</p><p>A full-length study of white women during the Civil War .George C.

But not without Uncle Ambrose. Every year it is Uncle Ambrose who makes Christmas sing, with his eloquent fiddle and his songs about angels. But as evening wears on with no sign of him Francis Rosalie fears that he may be in trouble. The snow can be deadly for a man with a crippled leg, and even Ambrose&#39;s warm heart and fiery spirit are no match for the driving wind and cold. &#34;Oh God, please take care of Uncle Ambrose!&#34; prays Frances Rosalie. It seems that nothing short of a Christmas miracle will bring Ambrose safely home. But who would have guessed that that miracle would be a great, black dog? Frances Ward Weller and Robert J. Blake, author and illustrator of Riptide, team up again to create a most unforgettable angel in this enchanting Christmas tale.</p><p>Ages 5^-8. The book opens with a picture of a girl looking out a window, a worried expression on her face. She is Frances Rosalie Murphy, and the time is 100 years ago. Frances Rosalie is waiting for her uncle Ambrose to arrive on the snowy Christmas Eve. Snow is a problem for lively Uncle Ambrose. An accident left him with a painful limp that makes it hard to walk in such bad weather. As Frances Rosalie recounts her concerns, readers will be immersed in the pictures that detail Uncle Ambrose's difficult excursion through snowy neighborhoods, out past the town, and over the river, each step more difficult until he slips and falls in a snowbank. Unable to get up, Uncle Ambrose is in real danger of freezing to death when a huge black dog appears, and Ambrose is led to safety. The dog is never seen again, nor is the dog familiar to anyone in the area. Was the dog a guardian angel? That's the way the story is passed down. Blake has made an interesting illustration decision: the pictures show only Ambrose's treacherous excursion, not what is happening in Frances Rosalie's house. A man struggling in the snow, even one in danger, may be of more interest to an older audience than to young kids, but no one can quibble with Blake's masterful paintings. Friendly at first, the landscape becomes icier and snowier as the story progresses--until the dramatic snow-drenched spread that shows Ambrose and the dog, tiny dots buried in drifts. Based on a true family story, this is a captivating tale, full of peril, mystery, and love. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>Grade 1-4?An original tale about an Irish family, set in New England "some hundred years ago." Uncle Ambrose is expected at his sister's house on Christmas Eve. The musician of the family, he is the one who makes "Christmas sing" for his niece, Frances. However, Uncle Ambrose has a bad leg, and when an evening's snow turns into a blizzard, the excited activity around the house turns to worry. He finally arrives, saved by a huge black dog that no one has ever seen before. The "angel" of Mill Street disappears into the night and the family goes to bed. The narrative has the rhythm and pacing of oral storytelling. On each double-page spread, the text is set in a narrow vertical strip next to a large illustration. While the text describes what is going on in the house, the paintings show Ambrose's trek, with the black dog always shadowing him, making the story read as if it were being simultaneously told aloud and acted out. Two wordless, double-page illustrations at the climax (Ambrose's tumble into a snowbank and rescue) add to the meticulous structure of the book. Blake's watercolors, with the blue hues of the outside set against the yellow hues of indoors and the increasingly obscuring and wind-blown snow, add nicely to this cozy and old-fashioned Christmas story.?Nina Lindsay, Oakland Public Library, <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jessica Jones: Avenger</h2><p>You've binge-watched her hit series, now binge-read Jessica Jones' greatest Avengers adventures - including every post-ALIAS/PULSE collaboration by her creators, Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos!

Religion uses the language of the arts, for it uses signs and symbols, like bridges from the visible to the invisible. The symbol is not an object of worship but invites us to worship. It leads to an encounter with the divine. Richly illustrated, <i>The Symbols of the Church </i>shows that the language of symbols is more universal than the language of words in expressing faith. Over 200 full-color photographs and illustrations depict a variety of symbols that range from bells to architecture to liturgical vestments. Commentary, poetry, scriptural text, prayers, musical excerpts, and quotes from well-known persons offer insight into the meaning and history of these symbols.</p><p><i>The Symbols of the Church</i> looks both beyond the church building and deep within it to find symbols relevant to Judeo-Christianity. First it recalls those principal sacred symbols&#x2014;sun, moon, stars, architectural figures, time, space&#x2014;which various cultures have made into a permanent and universal religious language and which were known to the Christian Church. Then it presents the evolution of the church building through time, from ancient temples to the modern church. Finally, it explores church furnishings and features&#x2014;the baptistry, the nave, the organ, sacred vessels, the vestiture of church ministers&#x2014;that are "permanent church signs."</p><p>Churches are a compendia of symbols. The celebrations which take place in them enact these symbols. Their interpretation cannot be improvised but is a product of the interpretation given by the Church throughout its history and in its teaching and liturgy. The Church turns to the more widely used symbols of religious language to express its faith and dispose each person to receive its vision of the churches. <i>The Symbols of the Church</i> offers a beautiful and thoughtful introduction to their symbolic meaning.</p><p>Part One: Symbols of the Christian World includes the sections "The World and Its Image," "The Inhabitants of the Heavenly and Terrestrial Worlds," "The World Subject to Humanity," and "Elements, Space, and Time." Topics included in these sections are The Heavenly Circle; The Depths; The Square of the Earth; The Ascent of the Heights; Temple; God of the Universe and Holy Trinity; Jesus Christ, God in our Midst; The World of Humanity; World of the Spirits; The Animal Kingdom; Plant World; Products of the Earth; Objects; Elements; Colors; Numbers; and Time.</p><p>Part Two: Church Symbolism includes the section "Evolution of Churches and Their Symbolism."

The church was established to serve chiefly gays and lesbians of various religious persuasions. Despite modest beginnings, internal schisms and the firebombings of 12 of his churches, Perry's mission was bolstered by formidable self-confidence--demonstrated in this less than modest chronicle coauthored with freelance writer Swicegood--and came to flourish in hundreds of churches established across the nation. Included along with accounts of gay activism in the '70s and '80s are personal stories of religious discovery and social solidarity which gays, rejected by established denominations (Perry himself was excommunicated for his sexual preference) affirm in his churches. Though its congregations have been thinned by AIDS, the Community's reach now extends to 34 countries. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is the powerful story of Perry and of the church he founded because he and others were rejected by Christian churches because of their homosexuality. Most interesting, perhaps, is the interactions with the National Council of Churches (NCC) and Perry's beliefs about what the Metropolitan Community Churches did for the NCC as a catalyst for shared Communion and other expressions of mutual Christian recognition among NCC members. There are also many notable events in the history of this 22-year-old denomination and its challenges to Christian ethical understandings.

Eight months later, the boat was found in mid-Atlantic with no one on board. Crowhurst&#39;s logs and diaries revealed that, although he had radioed messages from his supposed round-the-world course, he had in fact never left the Atlantic. This journalistic masterpiece reconstructs what happened: Crowhurst&#39;s growing distrust of his boat; his first decision to attempt one of the great hoaxes of our time; the lying radio transmissions; the ``triumphal&#39;&#39; return up the Atlantic as the elapsed-time race leader; and the fantastic ending. The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst is both a suspenseful narrative and a psychological casebook of human zeal and anguish.</p><p>What Are &#x201c;The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics?&#x201d; <p>No one meets the ocean on quite such intimate terms as the sailor in a small boat. No one experiences a solitude more absolute than that encountered by long-distance single-handed sailors like Joshua Slocum or Bernard Moitessier. Since the early nineteenth century, when Byron and Shelley put to sea in their own boats in order to set themselves adrift in nature at its most turbulent and unruly, writing and sailing have gone hand in hand. </p><p> </p><p>There have been writers who sailed&#x2014;Wilkie Collins, Joseph Conrad, Robert Louis Stevenson, Hilaire Belloc, Jack London, E.B. White, William Golding, John Barth, Thomas McGuane, Geoffrey Wolff&#x2014;along with a multitude of sailors who wrote, from Slocum and John Voss to Tristan Jones and the father-son team of Daniel and David Hays. After nearly two hundred years, the literature of small-boat voyaging under sail is enormous, and every publishing season sees more additions to the list. </p><p>It is the function of The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics to recognize and celebrate the relatively small number of truly important books in this library. Some have been chosen because the voyages they describe are themselves of unignorable merit; some because the sheer brilliance of their writing demands their inclusion. Most combine in equal parts serious nautical interest with literary excellence. </p><p>As general editor of the series, I am always trying to keep in mind the bookshelves on my own 35-foot ketch. A proper ship&#x2019;s library isn&#x2019;t restricted to books with boats in them, of course; I wouldn&#x2019;t happily set sail for more than a day or two without novels by Dickens, Trollope, Evelyn Waugh, and Saul Bellow, and poetry by Pope, Keats, Tennyson, Hardy, Philip Larkin, and Robert Lowell. The big question is which small-boat voyages can stand up in such exalted literary company? Not very many is the honest answer, and half the function of an editor is to know what he must reject. The books that won&#x2019;t figure in the series are as important as those that will. </p><p>We won&#x2019;t be publishing quaint curiosities. Period charm does not make a classic, and though I have a soft spot for, say, Nathaniel Bishop&#x2019;s Four Months in a Sneak Box (1879), and an even softer one for Maurice Griffiths&#x2019; The Magic of the Swatchways (1932), they won&#x2019;t be found in The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics. Nor will the many salty &#x201c;yarns&#x201d; full of the faded yo-ho-ho of generations past. Whimsical accounts of family vacations afloat (the obligatory adventure with the dog and the dinghy...) will be left to gather dust in peace. So will all those melancholy solo voyages in which the writers go to sea in order to discover themselves. </p><p>There remain the books whose vigor has not dimmed with the passage of time, whose voice is as alive and meaningful now as it was on their first publication&#x2014;the books that should be essential reading for every literate sailor. No. 2 in the series is Richard Maury&#x2019;s The Saga of Cimba, first published in 1939; No. 4 is The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst by Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall, first published in 1971. They are perfect examples of what I mean: one a loving close-up portrait of the sea in all its moods, written by a master mariner with an astonishing literary gift; the other a study, by two journalists, of a man who lost touch with reality during the course of the first singlehanded round-the-world yacht race. Each&#x2014;in its very different way&#x2014;is an indispensable book. Each contributes an important thread to the larger pattern in the carpet, which is the great, various, and intricate design of the literature of small-boat sailing. </p><p>The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics will surprise our readers with its richness and complexity. Since Homer&#x2019;s Odyssey, the voyage has supplied one of the classic forms in literature&#x2014;both as a grand metaphor for life itself in the long passage from birth to death, and as a sequence of tests and adventures. Equally, the boat (and especially the small boat) has long stood as a symbol of selfhood&#x2014;a fragile ark bearing the journeying soul to its destination. Hilaire Belloc put the matter beautifully in The Cruise of the Nona: </p><p> The cruising of a boat here and there is very much what happens to the soul of a man in a larger way... We are granted great visions, we suffer intolerable tediums, we come to no end of the business, we are lonely out of sight of England, we make astonishing landfalls&#x2014;and the whole rigmarole leads us along no whither, and yet is alive with discovery, emotion, adventure, peril and repose. Those five nouns should be emblazoned above The Sailor&#x2019;s Classics: it is from the interweaving of discovery, emotion, adventure, peril, and repose that the pattern of sailing literature is made, and we shall do our best to honor each and every one in our selection of the best books ever written about life aboard small boats at sea. Jonathan Raban<br> Series Editor<br> March 2001</p><p>"A masterpiece."--<i>The New Yorker</i> </p><p>In the autumn of 1968, Donald Crowhurst set out from England in an improbable-looking plywood trimaran to compete in the first singlehanded nonstop round-the-world sailboat race. Although his previous sailing experience was limited, his boat unready, and the electronic gadgetry of his own design unfinished and untested, Crowhurst had managed to persuade first an affluent backer, then the contest judges, and, finally, England's media to regard him as a serious contender. Sailing south through the Atlantic, he radioed reports of record-breaking sailing performances. In the South Atlantic he announced that low battery power would require him to maintain radio silence through the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Eleven weeks later he broke his silence to tell the world he had rounded Cape Horn and was sailing north for England, the elapsed-time leader of the race. Then tragedy struck. Eight months after his departure, Crowhurst's <i>Teignmouth Electron</i> was discovered adrift in an eerie mid-Atlantic calm, intact but without her skipper. </p><p>In this tour de force of investigative journalism, Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall tell the story of Donald Crowhurst's ill-fated voyage. Working from Crowhurst's recovered logs and diaries, the authors reconstruct the events leading up to his disappearance: his first few weeks at sea and his growing distrust of his boat; his attempts to come to grips with imminent failure; his decision to hide out midocean in the South Atlantic, away from the shipping lanes, faking a round-the-world journey; and his final, desperate escape from discovery as the would-be perpetrator of one of the biggest hoaxes in sailing history. </p><p>From in-depth interviews with Crowhurst's family and friends and telling excerpts from his logbooks, Tomalin and Hall develop a tale of tragic self-delusion and public deception, a haunting portrait of a complex, deeply troubled man and his journey into the heart of darkness. </p><p>With its first publication in 1970, <i>The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst</i> became an instant classic. Sir Francis Chichester, whose record-setting 1967 circumnavigation inspired the 1968 - 69 round-the-world race, called it "the sea drama of the century." Robin Knox-Johnston, the winner of the race, has called it "one of the great classic sea stories." You won't be able to put it down, and you won't be able to forget it. </p><p>A Daring Hoax and the Man It Destroyed </p><p>July 1969. After a voyage of 240 days, Donald Crowhurst was less than two weeks from a triumphant return to England, the apparent victor in the first nonstop singlehanded around-the-world sailboat race. All England was preparing for his arrival. But then he disappeared. His boat was found, sailing sedately, undisturbed--but he was not on it. From the logbooks he left behind, Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall reconstructed this extraordinary, deeply unsettling tale. . . . </p><p>"A virtuoso demonstration of the soul's anatomy."--<i>New York Times Book Review</i> </p><p>"One of the most moving and disturbing books I have ever read.

In the neighboring kingdom of Ix, malevolent Queen Zixi, six hundred and eighty-three years old and smug in the secrets of witchcraft, craves that magic cloak with all her evil heart.

She explains what happens in the body and mind when everything clicks and the perfect golf swing, tricky mathematical problem, or high-pressure business pitch suddenly become easy. With surprising insights on every page, Beilock examines how: attention and working memory guide human performance; how experience and practice, innate factors, and brain development interact to create our abilities; how these interconnected elements react to stress - explaining counterintuitive realities, like why the cleverest students do worst on standardized tests; why we may learn foreign languages best when we&#39;re not paying attention; why early childhood athletic training can backfire; and how our emotions can make us both smarter and dumber. The mind and body are in even closer communication than was ever thought - and breaks new ground on top of 30 years of integrative health investigations.</p><p>Sian L. Beilock is an associate professor in the Department of Psychology at The University of Chicago. She received a B.S. in Cognitive Science from the University of California, San Diego in 1997 and PhDs in both Kinesiology (sport psychology and motor learning) and Psychology from Michigan State University in 2003.Read it, especially if you work in education or are training to teach. * Independent on Sunday * Feature. * GQ Magazine * A fascinating look into the science of why so many of us collapse under pressure. * Daniel H.

Last Thanksgiving morning, in a fit of nostalgia, the two of them bundled up in layers, chunky handmade cable-knits over cotton turtlenecks, and staked out a spot near Macy's just after sunrise to watch the river of floating cartoon characters and lip-synching pop stars and freezing but-giddy high-school marching bands flowing down Broadway. Just as it should be. </p><p>But what Dakota most enjoyed about the beginning of winter was the crispness of the air (that practically demanded the wearing of knits) and the way that tough New Yorkers&#x2014;on the street, in elevators, in subways&#x2014;were suddenly willing to risk a smile. To make a connection with a stranger. To finally see one another after strenuously avoiding eye contact all year. </p><p>The excuse&#x2014;the expectation&#x2014;to bake also played a large part in her personal delight. Crumbly, melty shortbread cookies and iced chocolate-orange scones and whipped French vanilla cream cakes and sugary butter tarts: November through December was about whipping and folding and blending and sampling. Though she'd spent only one semester at pastry school so far, Dakota was eager to try out the new techniques she'd learned. </p><p>Still, she hadn't stopped to consider how it might feel to roll out crust, to pare fruit, to make a meal, back in what was her childhood home, as she adjusted her bulging backpack, groceries in each hand, and climbed the steep stairs two floors up to Peri's efficient little apartment situated one floor above the yarn shop her mother had started long ago, the tiny shop&#x2014;the shelves packed to bursting with yarns fuzzy, nubbly, itchy, and angel-soft, its walls a kaleidoscope of cocooning pastels and luxurious jewel shades&#x2014;that Georgia Walker had willed to her only child and that Dakota had, finally, come to truly appreciate.</p><br><p>The white-painted cupboard door creaked loudly as she opened it, surprising not because of the unpleasant volume but because Dakota realized, in that moment, she had forgotten the quirks of this particular kitchen. At the same time, overflowing bundles of yarn spilled&#x2014;burgundies and cobalts, wools and acrylics, lightweights and doubleknits&#x2014;from the shelves, tumbled to the grocery bags she'd just set on the counter, and then bounced to the linoleum tile floor below. Almost as an afterthought, a tidy pile of plush plum cashmere dropped noiselessly through the air, just missing her head, and landed directly into the small stainless sink. </p><p>"This isn't a kitchen!" cried Dakota, reaching out her arms as widely as was possible in her heavyweight white winter coat, trying to hug yarn and food and prevent all of it from rolling off the edge. "It's a storage facility!" </p><p>She hesitated. What she'd wanted was simply to find a bowl, something in which to pile up the apples she'd purchased, and she'd approached Peri's compact galley kitchen in the apartment above the Walker and Daughter yarn shop as if on automatic pilot. Distractedly running through a to-do list in her mind, Dakota lapsed into an old pattern and went directly to where her mother stored the dishes once upon a memory, back when the two Walkers lived in this same walk-up. And what did she find? Knitting needles of all sizes and woods stacked in the flatware drawer and oodles of yarn where the dishes ought to be, raining down from the cupboards. She wasn't sure she ought to risk a peek in the oven now that Peri lived here. </p><p>It had been a long time since she'd cooked in this location, making oatmeal, orange and blueberry muffins for her mother's friends, the founding members of the Friday Night Knitting Club. </p><p>"Seven years," marveled Dakota, her voice quiet though no one else was around. Seven years since she'd puttered around this kitchen after homework, smashing soft butter and sugar together as she contemplated what tidbits would go inside the week's cookies.</p><br><p>"Careful now," murmured Georgia, the shop ledger in front of her on the cramped kitchen table. "Maybe don't put in everything that's on the shelf. We went through two bags of coconut last week." </p><p>"Uh, those muffins were my best ever, Mom," said Dakota, prancing around in a victory dance on the worn linoleum. "The supreme moistness I've been searching for! You can't stand in the way of a chef." </p><p>"As long as this chef remembers that we're on a budget," Georgia said mildly, brushing away some bits of eraser from the page before her. "I think I created a monster the afternoon I taught you how to measure flour." </p><p>"Okay, Mom," said Dakota, sliding into a chair at the table. "Should I not make so much?" </p><p>Georgia's eyes crinkled as she regarded her lively daughter, whose ponytailed hair was falling loose from the neon-pink scrunchie she'd knitted herself. </p><p>"Never stop," she said, gently tugging her daughter's hair. "Don't give up something you love just because there's an obstacle. Find a way to work around it. Be open to something unexpected. Make changes." </p><p>"Like what?" "Like if you run out of sugar," she said. "Use honey." "I did that last week!" "I know," said Georgia. "I was proud of you. We Walker girls are creative. We knit. You bake. But above all, we never, ever give in." </p><br><p>Dakota surveyed the room. The kitchen was almost a relic, one of the few places in the apartment undamaged by last year's flooding, the bathroom down the hall being the source of the water that ruined the yarn shop in its previous incarnation but reminded all of them&#x2014;and especially Dakota&#x2014;of the importance of a mother's legacy. The store reopened soon after with a clean-and-simple style, with basic shelves for the merchandise, though she and Peri planned a massive remodel to begin in the not-too-distant future. That was all they'd talked about for months. The idea was to devote the shop space to a boutique for Peri's couture knitted and felted Peri Pocketbook handbags, and to adapt the first floor from a deli to a knitting caf�. Dakota's father, James Foster, was in charge of the new architecture but&#x2014;due to frequent changes from his, ahem, difficult clients&#x2014;hadn't finalized the drawings. It was a grand plan, a vision that required Dakota to hurry up and graduate from culinary school. Peri had been keeping everything under control for a long while, and the strain was showing. </p><p>"I don't want to miss my moment, Dakota," Peri reminded her, though she admitted she wasn't sure what that moment might be. Indeed, as Dakota grew older and struggled to keep her schedule in check, it had gradually begun to dawn on her how much Anita and Peri and even her father had worked tirelessly to fulfill her mother's dream of passing the store to Dakota. And even though Peri had a small ownership stake, even though Anita had helped out financially eons ago when Georgia bootstrapped her shop into being, even though James was her dad, everyone's sacrifices of time and energy belied self-interest as motivation. Amazing, truly, to know that one woman&#x2014;her mother, who always seemed just so regular and everyday with her reminders to zip up jackets and sleep tight&#x2014;had the grace of spirit to inspire such devotion. </p><p>Still, changes were coming all over, it seemed. Since leaving the V hotel chain, James's focus had been on his own architectural firm. Unfortunately, business wasn't exactly booming. The knit shop was also facing smaller revenues this quarter. Dakota didn't see the adventure in uncertainty. Too much change, she knew, could come to bad ends. </p><p></p><p>She eyed the clock, assessing the tidying she still needed to complete in the apartment. Dakota knew Peri was downstairs in the shop, finishing up the day's sales and awaiting the arrival of the club for their regular get-together. Those same women who were now Dakota's very own friends and mentors. The big sisters and, on some days, the surrogate mothers who were around whenever she needed to talk. The group would be gathering in the shop in a few hours to knit a little and talk a lot, catching up on one another's lives and prepping for the upcoming holidays. </p><p>To be fair, Peri had warned her, when the two of them struck their deal last week as they went over the bookkeeping for the week, that she had nothing in the kitchen. Absolutely nothing. Dakota was accustomed to that style of New York living, had other friends whose refrigerators held only milk and bottled water, a selection of cereal at the ready for every possible meal or snack. She had shopped for staples today, even salt and pepper, knowing full well to expect very little. The turkey and produce would come Wednesday, when she planned to make all the dishes and leave them for day-of reheating. Tonight her goal was merely to organize the space and stock the shelves. </p><p>Although these shelves were already overstocked with surplus inventory from the knit shop. Clearly. </p><p>Gingerly, Dakota stepped over the yarn and away from the green canvas totes covering the tiny strip of countertop between fridge and stove, their long handles flopped over every which way, as the onions and spices and celery threatened to spill right out of the bags with just a nudge in any direction. She glared at the groceries, hoping the power of her stare would keep them still, as she figured out where to unload the yarn. She listened for movement, in case the bags began to topple, as she pulled the door to the fridge just enough for the light to come on inside. Mercifully, it was empty&#x2014;not a yarn ball in sight&#x2014;and held only a dozen bottles of handcrafted root beer and a door filled with nail polish. Hastily, Dakota shoved most of the groceries into the fridge, even the five-pound bag of organic sugar. </p><p>But the relief at crossing something off her mental to-do list passed quickly. The truth was, her mind was bursting. There was just too much swirling around her. The past year had been the busiest of her life. Convincing everyone she was all grown-up led to a hard-won realization: She had to act like an adult. She had to handle new responsibilities. And it was a lot. Life, just the day-today, was a lot. She worried. Often. </p><p>Her mother had been a worrier as well. Everyone said so. But she'd been a smiler, too, witty and generous and seemingly able to make things fit together. </p><p>Right now Dakota spread her worries around, allowing time for concerns large and small. She worried about finding time to make two turkey dinners in the next week, mastering a perfect chocolate truffle cake before Monday's class, reading Catherine's latest installment in her mea-culpa novel about two former best friends who reconnect, and finishing the tidying of her room so her grandparents, Joe and Lillian Foster, would be comfortable staying at her father's apartment during Thanksgiving next week. That had been a task put off for too long, and Dakota spent several weekends earlier in November pulling boxes from her closet and underneath her bed, chuckling over sixth-grade book reports and old report cards and printouts of endless photos from the summer in Italy, waiting for frames or albums. She'd also spent a quiet, lonely day sifting through some of the odds and ends that had belonged to Georgia. Admiring the pencil drawings that accompanied the original pattern designs for the hand-knit suits and tunics and dresses her mother had outlined in a binder, the simpler sweaters destined for the charity pattern book she'd been assembling with Anita. And she read again the notes on knitting that her mother had kept in a small red journal that was passed on to Dakota after her death. </p><p>It was soothing to see Georgia's handwriting again, to imagine her mother curled up in a chair and scribbling. </p><p>"Get Christmas list from Dakota" was what her mother had scrawled in the margins of one of the pages. That comforted her, somehow. The proof of being on her mother's mind. To confirm what she already knew. </p><p>Dakota had taken to carrying that red journal with her, tucked in the bottom of her knitting bag&#x2014;an original by Peri&#x2014;along with an oversized unfinished camel-and-pastel-turquoise striped sweater she'd found. She'd kept all of her mother's UFOs, all the fun projects her mother never had a second to complete because she was too busy knitting her commissioned pieces, and just tucked them away for a later time. Every fall, Georgia's habit was to choose one of those on-the-go creations and finish it by the end of the year. A little gift of satisfaction to herself. That particular sweater was Georgia's UFO of choice the fall that she died, Dakota recalled vaguely, and Anita had bundled together all the knitting that hadn't been completed and placed it safely away. Too painful to look at, too precious to throw away: The unfinished objects had simply lain in wait until Dakota was ready. This she knew. </p><p>It struck her, as she was sorting and organizing, just how close she was getting to the age her mother was when she had arrived in New York. </p><p>During the great cleanup, she uncovered an old Polaroid that was fading and loose at the bottom of a box, of Georgia standing at the top of the Empire State Building, a knitted cap pulled down low on her unruly corkscrew curls and her mittened hands resting on her pink cheeks as she affected a look of surprise. She wondered if her father had been the photographer, if the two of them enjoyed their bird's-eye view of the skyscrapers all around. Dakota liked how the snap captured Georgia's goofy side, and she liked this concrete evidence that she had her mother's wide eyes, proof that the two of them were the same, just with different shades of skin. She tucked the photo into the red journal after scanning it onto her laptop, to the folder that held her story, with its images of Gran and the shop, and a picture of Ginger and Dakota standing in front of the Roman Forum. </p><p>She felt guilty that she hadn't spent as much time with Lucie Brennan's daughter, Ginger, since she started culinary school, and that she'd broken four lunch dates with KC Silverman in as many weeks. She had planned to finish a pair of matching fisherman's sweaters for Darwin Chiu's twins, Cady and Stanton, when they turned one; of course, they were already over eighteen months and the sweaters were now too small. She'd have to save them for a decade until someone else she knew had a baby. </p><p>Not to mention that she fretted whether Anita and Marty Popper would finally say "I do" at the wedding they rescheduled for New Year's Day ins...</p></p><h2>The Boot Room Boys: The Unseen Story of Anfield&#39;s Conquering Heroes</h2><p><b>Picture this: Saturday afternoons at Anfield, passionate terraces, a sea of red and Liverpool FC rules the world.</b><br><br> The Boot Room story starts in 1959 when Bill Shankly arrived and converted a 12 x 12storage room into a meeting place for him and his coaches, a move that had momentous consequences, both for the Club and British football.<br><br> Fans in the Kop will remember the heart-stopping extra time of the 1965 FA Cup Final, and the jubilation of winning the treble in 1984.

His mercy is infinitely greater than our sins,&#x201d; he writes. As well, the Church cannot close the door on anyone, Francis asserts&#x2014;on the contrary, its duty is to go out into the world to find its way into the consciousness of people so that they can assume responsibility for, and move away from, the bad things they have done.<br><br> The first Jesuit and the first South American to be elected Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis has traveled around the world spreading God&#x2019;s message of mercy to the largest crowds in papal history. Clear and profound, <i>The Name of God Is Mercy</i> resonates with this desire to reach all those who are looking for meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, and the healing of physical and spiritual wounds.

Where did the inspiration come from?<br><br> There was no particular or defining moment. Things come to me by themselves, they are the ways of the Lord, and they are preserved in prayer. I am inclined never to trust my first reaction to an idea or to a proposal that is made to me. I never trust myself in part because my first reaction is usually wrong. I have learned to wait, to trust in the Lord, to ask for his help, so I can discern better and receive guidance.<br><br> I can say that the centrality of mercy, which for me is Jesus&#x2019; most important message, has slowly evolved over the years in my work as a priest, as a consequence of my experience as a confessor, and thanks to the many positive and beautiful stories that I have known.<br><br> As early as July 2013, only a few months after being named Pope, when you were returning from Rio de Janeiro, where the World Day of Youth had been celebrated, you said that ours is a time of mercy.<br><br> Yes, I believe that this is an age of mercy. The Church is showing her maternal side, her motherly face, to a humanity that is wounded. She does not wait for the wounded to knock on her doors, she looks for them on the streets, she gathers them in, she embraces them, she takes care of them, she makes them feel loved. And so, as I said, and I am ever more convinced of it, this is a kair�s, our era is a kair�s of mercy, an opportune time. When John XXIII solemnly opened the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, he said, &#x201c;The Bride of Christ prefers to use the medicine of mercy rather than arm herself with the weapons of rigor.&#x201d; In his meditation &#x201c;Thoughts on Death,&#x201d; the blessed Paul VI revealed the essence of his spiritual life in the synthesis proposed by Saint Augustine: poverty and mercy. &#x201c;My poverty&#x2014;Pope Montini wrote&#x2014;the mercy of God. That I may at least honor who you are, God of infinite bounty, invoking, accepting, and celebrating your sweet mercy.&#x201d; Saint John Paul II took the notion further with his encyclical Dives in Misericordia, in which he affirmed that the Church lives an authentic life when it professes and proclaims mercy, the most amazing attribute of the Creator and Redemptor, and when it leads humanity to the font of mercy. In addition, he instituted the festivity of Holy Mercy, endorsed the figure of Saint Faustina Kowalska, and focused on Jesus&#x2019; words on mercy. Even Pope Benedict XVI also spoke of this in his teachings: &#x201c;Mercy is in reality the core of the Gospel message; it is the name of God himself, the face with which he revealed himself in the Old Testament and fully in Jesus Christ, incarnation of Creative and Redemptive Love. This love of mercy also illuminates the face of the Church, and is manifested through via the Sacraments, in particular that of the Reconciliation, as well as in works of charity, both of community and individuals. Everything that the Church says and does shows that God has mercy for man.&#x201d;<br><br> I also have many personal memories of other episodes related to the subject. For example, before coming here, when I was in Buenos Aires, I specifically recall a roundtable discussion with theologians. The topic was what the Pope could do to bring people closer together; we were faced with so many problems that there seemed to be no solution. One of the participants suggested &#x201c;a Holy Year of forgiveness.&#x201d; This idea stayed with me. And therefore, to answer your question, I believe that the decision came through prayer, through reflection on the teachings and declarations of the Popes who preceded me, and by thinking of the Church as a field hospital, where treatment is given above all to those who are most wounded. A Church that warms people&#x2019;s hearts with its closeness and nearness.<br><br> What is mercy for you?<br><br> Etymologically, &#x201c;mercy&#x201d; derives from misericordis, which means opening one&#x2019;s heart to wretchedness. And immediately we go to the Lord: mercy is the divine which embraces attitude, it is God&#x2019;s giving himself to us, accepting us, and bowing to forgive. Jesus said he came not for those who were good but for the sinners. He did not come for the healthy, who do not need the doctor, but for the sick. For this reason, we can say that mercy is God&#x2019;s identity card. God of Mercy, merciful God. For me, this really is the Lord&#x2019;s identity. I was always impressed by the story of Jerusalem as it is told in chapter 16 of the Book of Ezekiel. The story compares Jerusalem to a little girl whose umbilical cord wasn&#x2019;t cut, who was left in her blood and was cast out. God saw her wallowing in blood, he washed the blood from her, he anointed her, he dressed her, and when she grew up he adorned her with silk and jewels. But she, infatuated with her own beauty, became a harlot, not for money but paying her lovers herself. God, however, will never forget his covenant and he will place her above her sisters so that Jerusalem will remember and be ashamed (Ezekiel 16:63), when she is forgiven for what she has done.<br><br> For me this is one of the most important revelations: you will continue to be the chosen people and all your sins will be forgiven. So mercy is deeply connected to God&#x2019;s faithfulness. The Lord is faithful because he cannot deny himself. This is explained well by Saint Paul in the Second Letter to Timothy: &#x201c;If we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.&#x201d; You can deny God, you can sin against him, but God cannot deny himself. He remains faithful.<br><br> What place and meaning do mercy have in your heart, life, and personal history? Do you remember your first experience of mercy as a child?<br><br> I can read my life in light of chapter 16 of the book of the prophet Ezekiel. I read those pages and I say: everything here seems written just for me. The prophet speaks of shame, and shame is a grace: when one feels the mercy of God, he feels a great shame for himself and for his sin. There is a beautiful essay by a great scholar of spirituality, Father Gaston Fessard, on the subject of shame in his book The Dialectic of the &#x201c;Spiritual Exercises&#x201d; of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Shame is one of the graces that Saint Ignatius asks for during his confession of his sins before Christ crucified. That text from Ezekiel teaches us to be ashamed, it shows us how to feel shame: with all our history of wretchedness and sin, God remains faithful and raises us up. I feel this. I don&#x2019;t have any particular memories of mercy as a young child. But I do as a young man. I think of Father Carlos Duarte Ibarra, the confessor I met in my parish church on September 21, 1953, the day the Church celebrated Saint Matthew the apostle and Evangelist. I was seventeen years old. On confessing to him, I felt welcomed by the mercy of God. Ibarra was originally from Corrientes but was in Buenos Aires to receive treatment for leukemia. He died the following year. I still remember how when I got home, after his funeral and burial, I felt as though I had been abandoned. And I cried a lot that night, really a lot, and hid in my room. Why? Because I had lost a person who helped me feel the mercy of God, a person who helped me understand the expression miserando atque eligendo, an expression I didn&#x2019;t know at the time but which I would eventually choose as my episcopal motto. I learned about it later, from the homilies of the English monk Venerable Bede. When describing the calling of Matthew, he writes: &#x201c;Jesus saw the tax collector, and by having mercy chose him as an Apostle, saying to him, &#x2018;Follow me.&#x2019; &#x201d; This is the translation commonly given for the words of Saint Bede. I like to translate miserando with another gerund that doesn&#x2019;t exist: mercifying. So, &#x201c;mercifying and choosing&#x201d; describes the vision of Jesus, who gives the gift of mercy and chooses, and takes unto himself.</p><h2>The Circle of Jewish Life</h2><p>The life cycle of an observant Jewish family from birth to death in words and illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>Dodsworth in Paris (A Dodsworth Book)</h2><p>Dodsworth and his (crazy) friend the duck have just arrived in Paris.

Though Dodsworth has cautioned the duck, "You can't cause any trouble here," his companion gets into one escapade after another, from escaping the hotel to ring the bells at Notre Dame to folding all of their money into paper airplanes to fly off the Eiffel Tower. Egan's cartoon-style ink and watercolor illustrations enhance the comedy. Kids are sure to enjoy the zany humor and identify with the duck's playful nature. Some French words ("beret," "debonair," "<i>magnifique," "bonjour," "monsieur"</i>) are an interesting addition to this easy reader while others are easily understood through the illustrations and context. A few are harder to decipher. Though their inclusion may prove challenging for some students, more sophisticated readers will likely be undeterred. At the end of the story, Dodsworth and the duck are seen floating off in a hot-air balloon toward England.&#x2014;<i>Jackie Partch, Multnomah County Library, Portland, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

SUNDAY TIMES SPORT BOOK OF THE YEAR. From its late-Victorian flowering in the mill towns of the northwest of England, football spread around the world with great speed. It was helped on its way by a series of missionaries who showed the rest of the planet the simple joys of the game. Even now, in many countries, the colloquial word for a football manager is not &#39;coach&#39; or &#39;boss&#39; but &#39;mister&#39;, as that is how the early teachers were known, because they had come from the home of the sport to help it develop in new territories. In Rory Smith&#39;s stunning new book Mister, he looks at the stories of these pioneers of the game, men who left this country to take football across the globe. Sometimes, they had been spurned in their own land, as coaching was often frowned upon in England in those days, whe players were starved of the ball during the week to make them hungry for it on matchday. So it was that the inspirations behind the &#39;Mighty Magyars&#39; of the 1950s, the Dutch of the 1970s or top clubs such as Barcelona came from these shores. England, without realising it, fired the very revolution that would remove its crown, changing football&#39;s history, thanks to a handful of men who sowed the seeds of the inversion of football&#39;s natural order. This is the story of the men who taught the world to play and shaped its destiny. This is the story of the Misters.</p><p>Rory Smith joined The Times as one of its leading football writers in 2012, having previously written for the Daily Telegraph, and he now writes for the New York Times.

In one such magazine, he found a photograph of bodybuilder Glenn Bishop on Fire Island. &#x201c;Fire Island sounded exotic, perhaps a name made up by the photographer,&#x201d; he recalls in the preface to his latest monograph. &#x201c;I had no idea it was a real place. Certainly, I had no idea then that it was a place I would one day call home.&#x201d; In 1970, fresh out of law school, Bianchi began traveling to New York, and was invited to spend a weekend at Fire Island Pines, where he encountered a community of gay men. Using an SX-70 Polaroid camera, Bianchi documented his friends&#x2019; lives in the Pines, amassing an image archive of people, parties and private moments. These images, published here for the first time, and accompanied by Bianchi&#x2019;s moving memoir of the era, record the birth and development of a new culture. Soaked in sun, sex, camaraderie and reverie, <i>Fire Island Pines </i>conjures a magical bygone era.<br><br><b>Tom Bianchi</b> was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and graduated from Northwestern University School of Law in 1970.

(Antwaun Sargent <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>" My first impression of Fire Island was, Oh my god, a magic place exists, for real - a place that I had dreamed about", says Bianchi, whose Polaroid photos of men frolicking at the Pines have become a poignant social document of gay life pre-AIDS. " It was a place that gave birth to my soul as an artist, because I found myself in a community of enormously creative and supportive people who were saying, ' Yeah, go for it!' in ways that our families never could understand." For those born too late to experience that world, there is now Fire Island Pines, a handsome collection of Bianchi's photos that capture the sun, sex, and camaraderie of that lost era.

I could not have imagined then that my Polaroids would so suddenly become a record of a lost world&#x2015;my box of pictures a mausoleum, too painful to visit. When I reopened the box decades later, I found friends and lovers playing and smiling. Alive again.&#x201d; &#x2015;Tom Bianchi (Editors <i>OUT Magazine</i>)<br><br>This year, Fire Island&#x2019;s legendary enclave the Pines celebrates its 60th anniversary season, but its real heyday dates to the 1970s and early &#x2019;80s, when fit young men started streaming into the area, earning the Pines its reputation as a sand-swept gay bacchanal. Tom Bianchi&#x2019;s Polaroids captured the liberated mood of those days, and they&#x2019;re now collected in a handsome book, &#x201c;Tom Bianchi: Fire Island Pines&#x201d; (Damiani). (Alex Hawgood <i>The New York Times: T Magazine</i>)<br><br>"I wanted to make a book about these people that's going to be interesting 100 years from now," says Tom Bianchi of his new volume, Fire Island Pines: Polaroids 1975-1983 (Damiani), which depicts eight summers of gay life on the Long Island sandbar. "In taking the photos, my first mission was to show that boys like me knew they had a place to go, and the second was to let the world know there was nothing threatening about us," says Bianchi of his intimate, sun-dappled images. The book's subjects&#x2015;shown frolicking at the beach, lazing in bed, dancing, holding each other, and hanging out in modernist beach houses&#x2015;are palpably exhilarating, and the sense of joy is so immersive that it's easy to forget, if just for a few minutes, the waiting epilogue that struck the gay community soon after. "The book has for me a profound emotional resonance," says the 67-year-old photographer, who lives in Palm Springs but still spends several weeks every summer on Fire Island. "I'm looking at myself and many other young men who were vividly alive and celebrating their freedom for the first time."<br><br>That celebration, of course, involved easy sex, which is imprinted throughout the book in the group shots of beautiful men who seemed to live primarily in and out of Speedos. "Being a sort of horny devil, I can remember a beautiful figure emerging from the surf, saying &#x2018;Hi,' getting a smile back, and finding your life transformed in a moment," says Bianchi. "It was about the connectivity. I tried to give a sense of the world we lived in. I found very strong connections between us, our style and the place&#x2015;you would never attempt a community anywhere but in a place that beautiful."<br><br>Bianchi took a prototype of the book to a major publisher in 1980; editors loved it but the sales team blanched and quashed the project. In the years since, Bianchi became known as one of the premier horny devils of male-physique photography via a number of art books devoted to the classic nude. "But I always knew the time would come for the Fire Island book," he says. "I hope it's available to a younger audience who can see how gay freedom started and what it looked like." Bianchi takes a freighted pause. "I can't say we martyred ourselves. We had no choice. The world was too beautiful, and we had too much fun."

It was five feet long, with steel-blue scales, luminescent eyes and remarkable limb-like fins, unlike those of any fish she had ever seen. Determined to preserve her unusual find, she searched for days for a way to save it, but ended up with only the skin and a few bones.</p><p> A charismatic amateur ichthyologist, J.L.B. Smith, saw a thumbnail sketch of the fish and was thunderstruck. He recognized it as a coelacanth (pronounced see-la-kanth), a creature known from fossils dating back 400 million years and thought to have died out with the dinosaurs. With its extraordinary limbs, the coelacanth was believed to be the first fish to crawl from the sea and evolve into reptiles, mammals and eventually mankind. The discovery was immediately dubbed the "greatest scientific find of the century." </p><p> Smith devoted his life to the search for a complete specimen, a fourteen-year odyssey that culminated in a dramatic act of international piracy. As the fame of the coelacanth spread, so did rumors and obsessions. Nations fought over it, multimillion-dollar expeditions were launched, and submarines hand-built to find it. In 1998, the rumors and the truth came together in a gripping climax, which brought the coelacanth back into the international limelight.</p><p><em>A Fish Caught in Time</em> is the entrancing story of the most rare and precious fish in the world--our own great uncle forty million times removed.</p></p><p>In 1938, an alert young South African museum curator named Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer came upon a curious specimen in a fisherman's nets: a fish with "four limb-like fins and a strange little puppy dog tail," one that she thought resembled not a living being so much as a china ornament. When she could turn up no written descriptions of the find, she turned to other scientists for help, touching off a worldwide wave of interest in the creature that would come to be called the "coelacanth," long thought to be extinct, and now celebrated as one of the world's oldest species.<p> That interest took many forms, writes journalist Samantha Weinberg in her entertaining and instructive case study in scientific detective work. It spurred the development of new deep-sea craft to explore the farthest reaches of the ocean; it touched off more than one controversy over the coelacanth's lineage, and even over which nation claimed sovereignty over its oceanic haunts; and it launched or advanced the careers of dozens of researchers. The coelacanth continues to make news. In 1998, a young American scholar found a specimen in Indonesia, far from the western Indian Ocean waters where the coelacanth was thought to dwell. Although some scientists decried the discovery as a hoax at worst and an aberration at best, the find showed that the creature's range was widespread. It demonstrated, too, that international cooperation was necessary if the coelacanth were to be protected in the future, "continuing to exist," as Weinberg writes, "after this extraordinary duration of time." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Samantha Weinberg is a British writer and traveler.

His 2003 book, Khrushchev: The Man and his Era, won both the Pulitzer Prize for biography and the National Book Critics Circle Award for biography in 2004. Taubman has been the President of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, and chairs the Advisory Committee of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars in Washington.&#39;A phenomenally researched life of the man who did more than any other to change Europe and the world in the last half of the 20th century.&#39; -- Jonathan Steele * The Guardian * `In the centenary year of the Russian Revolution, the standout biography is about the man who lowered the hammer and sickle flag. Gorbachev: His Life and Times is a fitting sequel to William Taubman&#39;s previous biography of Nikita Khrushchev, which won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 2004.&#39; -- John Bew * New Statesman * &#39;William Taubman&#39;s Gorbachev, like his Khrushchev, is an extraordinary achievement, full of new information, filled with shrewd judgments, a two-in-a-row triumph in the writing of great lives.&#39; -- John Lewis Gaddis, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of George F. Kennan: An American Life &#39;An engaging, poignant portrayal of one of the most significant of Russian leaders.&#39; * Kirkus review * &#39; ... deeply penetrating history and engrossing psychological study.&#39; -- Robert Legvold * Foreign Affairs Magazine * `Vivid and intelligent... Wonderfully cinematic narrative.&#39; -- Neil Ascherson * London Review of Books * `A masterpiece of narrative scholarship. It is also the first comprehensive biography of this world-historical figure. Other chronicles of Gorbachev&#39;s life and verdicts on his record will follow, but they will be without the trove of personal insights that Taubman has gleaned from his access to Gorbachev himself, his advisers, and other participants in those dramatic years.&#39; -- Strobe Talbott * New York Review of Books * `A fascinating, perceptive, and compelling account of the life of a brilliant, driven, but flawed leader... Taubman, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2003 biography of Nikita Khrushchev, once again displays his impressive grasp of the inner workings of the now vanished communist system that made the Soviet Union, for a half century, the most powerful and deadly foe of the West... Magisterial.&#39; * The Boston Globe * `Superb... [Gorbachev] thought he could save the Soviet Union and make socialism great again. In Taubman&#39;s hands, the journey is an extraordinary story of one man and history in a tense wrestling match.&#39; * The Washington Post * `Comprehensive and immensely readable.&#39; * The Economist * `Impressive... full of fascinating detail.&#39; -- Peter Conradi * Sunday Times * `Nobody before Taubman has achieved an in-depth psychological portrait...what made Gorbachev tick, as a man and a leader, has always been hooded in speculation...A highly readable, reliable and accurate work, one that will be used by all future generations of historians... This monumental biography will become the standard personal portrait, especially of the years before Gorbachev became party secretary. Taubman has charmed more out of him than any of his subordinates ever managed to.&#39; -- Robert Service * Literary Review * `This is a meticulously researched, carefully nuanced and immensely readable biography of a remarkable, but insufficiently understood, twentieth century political leader. Taubman&#39;s book is destined to remain the fullest and most authoritative life of Gorbachev for years to come.&#39; -- Archie Brown, author of The Myth of the Strong Leader and The Rise and Fall of Communism `William Taubman has now done for Gorbachev what he had previously done for Khrushchev, giving us the full life deeply grounded in the Soviet and Russian archives, here with the added benefit of Gorbachev&#39;s complete cooperation. Perhaps a hundred years from now, when our perspective on Russia&#39;s role in the world has further clarified, another biography will be needed.

During World War II after the beginning of the bombardment of Sofia, Peter Deunov moved with a group of his followers to the village Murchaevo, in the Vitosha Mountains where they were welcomed into the home of Temelko. Here he gave his last directions and guidance, summarizing his previous lectures and outlining the future of humanity. These last words were taken down in shorthand and presented by his closest disciples Bojan Boev and Boris Nikolov in the book The Wellspring of Good. The Master shares deep insights into the inner realities of life, covering a vast array of subjects, including Paneurhythmy, Communion with Nature, Music, The Law of Love, Cosmic Consciousness, The Colors, Joy, Rejuvenation, The Culture of the Angels, The New Epoch, etc. &#34;When I speak about the new man, I have in mind the people of the Sun who live with Joy. They are exuberant, generous, and overcome their difficulties easily. They are heroes, men with open hearts. They use everything wisely. They enjoy everything. In both suffering and pleasure, the new man is filled with an inner joy. He knows that both the bad and the good conditions are given in order for him to grow.&#34; (Peter Deunov) Peter Deunov (also known as Beinsa Douno), is a teacher of Esoteric Christianity, who lived and taught in Bulgaria during the first half of the 20th century. His knowledge, character, and powers, all mark him as a rare messenger of Divine Reality. He had a very large following when he passed on, but his teaching was suppressed by the Communist regime. In recent years, this teaching, and its associated spiritual practices, have begun to bloom again, as the Bulgarians enjoy a greater degree of freedom. This teaching covers all aspects of life, with a special emphasis on music, spiritual dance (Paneurhythmy), and communion with God in Nature. This fourth edition includes: - a Preface by professor Harrie Salman - improved translations of the 134 chapters from the original Bulgarian - a timeline with the dates and events from the Master&#39;s life - an appendix providing the historical context of the Master&#39;s time in Marchaevo, where the events transcribed in this book occurred - an expanded set of photographs from lives of the Master and his followers</p><p></p><h2>Night Soldiers</h2><p>After his brother is murdered by Bulgarian fascists in 1934, Khristo Stoianev is recruited by the Soviet intelligence service, the NKVD, trained in Moscow, and sent to Spain to serve Russian interests in the Spanish Civil War</p><p>11 1.5-hour cassettesBulgaria, 1934. A young man is murdered by the local fascists. His brother, Khristo Stoianev, is recruited into the NKVD, the Soviet secret intelligence service, and sent to Spain to serve in its civil war. Warned that he is about to become a victim of Stalin's purges, Khristo flees to Paris. Night Soldiers masterfully re-creates <br>the European world of 1934&#x2013;45: the struggle between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia for Eastern Europe, the last desperate gaiety of the beau monde in 1937 Paris, and guerrilla operations with the French underground in 1944.

Still, thousands of Jews in these small towns survived the war and returned afterward to rebuild their communities. The recollections of some 400 returnees in Ukraine provide the basis for Jeffrey Veidlinger&#x2019;s reappraisal of the traditional narrative of 20th-century Jewish history. These elderly Yiddish speakers relate their memories of Jewish life in the prewar shtetl, their stories of survival during the Holocaust, and their experiences living as Jews under Communism. Despite Stalinist repressions, the Holocaust, and official antisemitism, their individual remembrances of family life, religious observance, education, and work testify to the survival of Jewish life in the shadow of the shtetl to this day.</p></p><p>Winner, 2014 Canadian Jewish Book Awards, history category<p>Jeffrey Veidlinger is Joseph Brodsky Collegiate Professor of History and Judaic Studies at the University of Michigan.

Kel), has finally been knighted. Never one to rest on her laurels, Kel champs at the bit, ready to tackle the horrific magic killing devices she was shown in the Chamber of the Ordeal during her knighthood initiation. The huge, insectlike machines, "made of iron-coated giants' bones, chains, pulleys, dagger-fingers and -toes, and a long whiplike tail," feed on the souls of dead children and are systematically killing off the citizens and warriors of Tortall. <p> Thoroughly disgusted to discover that not only is she not going to be assigned a combat post, but she has been placed in charge of a refugee camp instead, Kel, in her usual noble, stoic way, swallows her disappointment and sets out being the best refugee camp commander possible. Of course, destiny has a way of sneaking up on a young woman like Kel, and soon she is fulfilling the ordeal the Chamber set out for her... and then some.</p><p> Tamora Pierce once again draws her legions of fans into her story, blending humor, pathos, exhilarating battles, and gripping drama with a very real, very appealing protagonist. It's easy to make war appear black and white, a matter of good versus evil. Pierce finds the shades of gray.

She is torn between a duty she has sworn and a quest that she feels could turn the tide of the war. . . .<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Fugitives of the Forest: The Heroic Story of Jewish Resistance and Survival During the Second World War</h2><p><p>As the Second World War and the Nazi assault on Europe ended, some 25,000 Jews, entire families in some instances, walked out of the forests of Eastern Europe. For three years, these men, women and children had miraculously survived eluding Nazi hunts and Soviet, Polish, and Ukrainian partisans who often killed first and asked questions later. They had escaped from the Nazi ghettos and slave labor camps and formed secret partisan camps in the surrounding forests. The forest not only protected them, it also became their base for sabotage and resistance efforts against the Germans and their allies. </p><p>Based on numerous interviews with the survivors themselves, <i>Fugitives of the Forest</i> tells the harrowing and heroic story of those who resisted amid such perilous conditions.

She lives in Eugene, Oregon.With its bold graphics, attractive cover and clear, concise recipes, Vollstedt's latest has all the signs of an interesting work. Unfortunately, unlike James Peterson's excellent primer Splendid Soups, this book gives only cursory treatment to the principals of soup- and stew-making. Moreover, the facile introductory notes rarely describe the finished dish, let alone mention technique. Vollstedt (The Big Book of Casseroles) tells readers that Bean and Beer Soup with Ham is perfect for "game watching on TV," and a broccoli, mushroom and peanut butter soup is just the thing for the "peanut butter fan." In another instance, Vollstedt assumes that her readers will not know how to pronounce "ratatouille" (the Union Street Ratatouille recipe offers a phonetic spelling), yet takes it for granted that they will know how her recipe, which calls for slow-roasting the vegetables to a gelatinous heap, differs from the classic version. Perhaps it sounds like a quibble, but the book contains many such omissions. Then there is the matter of the recipes themselves. While some of them will no doubt appeal to people with large families and their children what child wouldn't adore Spaghetti Soup? more sophisticated readers may long for, well, more sophisticated dishes. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Jazz Portraits: An Eye for the Sound : Images of Jazz and Jazz Musicians</h2><p>A profile of contemporary jazz brings readers to the clubs of the 1940s and describes the work of such figures as Art Blakey, Miles Davis, Johnny Hodges, and Chet Baker through quotes, anecdotes, and black-and-white photography.</p><p></p><h2>The Great Cookie Thief</h2><p>The story takes place back in the days of the wild west.

It was an excellent introduction to the field and a popular text for many college classes. After 30 years (and a couple of revisions), the new edition is, if possible, even better than its predecessors. Rather than just rehash old research, the author includes new discoveries and revises his conclusions about many aspects of the field. Particularly interesting and enlightening is his ability to remove "Greek art...from the traditional art book and gallery" and focus on what the works meant to their makers and viewers and, consequently, to later artists.

Ford is the author of books dealing with scientific subjects, including Images of Science, The First Encyclopedia of Science, and Microbe Power-Tomorrow&#39;s Revolution. His scientific discoveries are featured in major science textbooks.This study of the abilities of all sorts of creatures to sense and interact with the world will leave many readers impressed and at least buffeted, if not convinced, by the author's passionate approach. Cambridge University scientist Ford (Images of Science; Microbe Power) has in effect written two books at once. The first surveys many species' social, cognitive and sensory powers. The second is a call for eco-awareness and for animalAand plant and microbeArights: "All animals and plants sense their surroundings, and thus they all have feelings." A chapter on mammals' mental processes explains how mole rats search and socialize underground, how primates learn to use medicinal plants and how prairie dog colonies learn from experience. Turning to avians, Ford covers birdsong, echolocation and gulls' mating postures. Later chapters deal with reactive abilities among flora and protozoa. A fertilized ovum, like any single-celled organism, Ford suggests, has "its own sense"; as to whether the cell is self-aware, "we know too little... to decide." Ford's practical suggestions for reducing cruelty (e.g., vets should use soft tables) are useful. Most lay readers will admire his fascinating survey of creaturely powers and may be sympathetic to his call to "value the global network of all plants and animals, and react to their presence with respect." But though it trails a dazzling set of facts, Ford's call for "a new vitalism" seems less scientific (or philosophical) than quasi-religiousAand it's unevenly argued, though deeply felt.

Prisley, U.S. Navy (retired)<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This small, but fact filled book should be required reading for everyone involved in submarine and antisubmarine warfare - both ashore and afloat, and makes an unusually good desk-top reference for day-to-day use. Stan Zimmerman was editor of Navy News &amp; Undersea Technology from 1988 to 1994, covering current developments in the field, winning a number of awards as journalist, reporter, and correspondent, and has had a number of his articles published in Proceedings. This second edition (first edition 1990) stands by itself to bring submarine technology up to date. Zimmerman also has written a companion piece, Submarine Design for the 21st Century. It is clear from his coverage of all the subjects, and his obvious understanding and appreciation of them, that he is competent in this field.</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a remarkably complete and well-researched handbook that details all aspects of submarine technology, with easy-to-understand explanations of the broad, esoteric, and complex technologies involved, making it relatively easy for laymen to follow. Zimmerman stresses the significance of submarines not only in today's world, but also in the 21st century. He explains the basics of nuclear propulsion: diesels and air-independent propulsion (AIP); batteries and fuel cells. There is comprehensive coverage of submarine torpedoes, and missiles, hydrodynamics, acoustics, and enough attention to non-acoustic phenomena to understand their significance in submarine warfare. Each relevant subject is covered in detail as is the importance of modern combat systems for submarines today-and in the future.</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extensive end notes for each chapter provide sources and references for all of Zimmerman's statements and discussion. He includes tables to show relevant statistics, and figures to clarify such complex systems as nuclear power, AIP systems, and submarine fire control techniques, while ample side bars emphasize and highlight various issues like non acoustic antisubmarine warfare.</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical information is up-to-date, with details about Russian weapons and submarines, as well as U.S. navy developments of interest. Much of this information will be new to many readers who do not follow professional journals or technical intelligence matters.

But then a conversation with an Army recruiter in her high-school cafeteria changes the course of her life. Hired as a linguist, she quickly has to find a space for herself in the testosterone-filled world of the Army barracks, and has been holding her own until the unthinkable happens: she is raped by a fellow soldier.<br>Struggling with PTSD and commanders who don't trust her story, Dostie finds herself fighting through the isolation of trauma amid the challenges of an unexpected war. What follows is a riveting story of one woman's extraordinary journey to prove her worth, physically and mentally, in a world where the odds are stacked against her.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2019:</strong> Until I read <em>Formation: A Woman&#x2019;s Memoir of Stepping Out of Line</em>, I hadn&#x2019;t realized that I&#x2019;d grown habituated to the simplistic, single-hump emotional rollercoaster of most memoirs. Ryan Leigh Dostie&#x2019;s story of her life so far&#x2014;raised in a matriarchal cult in Connecticut, joining the army to pursue her love of languages, her sexual assault by a fellow solider, deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the crippling aftershocks of PTSD&#x2014;flings the reader around so many unsettling corkscrews as well as breathtaking highs and lows that you may stagger when you flip the final page. The core of Dostie&#x2019;s story is not her tour in Iraq; nor is it the military itself, which she admits she often loved. The assault, followed by the army&#x2019;s determination that her accusation is &#x201c;unsubstantiated&#x201d; despite evidence to the contrary, claws away at Dostie&#x2019;s confidence and self-worth, propelling her along dangerous paths. But <em>Formation</em> is a war memoir, too. Her stories about battle and occupation will sound familiar to regular readers of the genre, as will the psychological impacts that gut the soldiers on the ground. When a male soldier tells her, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can ever love again,&#x201d; she&#x2019;s terrified of this insight even as numbness swells inside her as well. True life rarely hews to a predicable narrative structure, and Dostie refuses to perpetuate that myth, penning a memoir that inspires, terrifies, enrages, and prompts triumphant fist-pumping all at once. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review</em><b>Ryan Leigh Dostie</b> is a novelist turned soldier turned novelist.

Running Guide</i> (with Don Carter.) His writing has also appeared in the <i>Boston Globe, SPORT </i>magazine, the <i>Boston Phoenix, </i>the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and a wide variety of other publications. He is the primary jazz record reviewer for the <i>Globe </i>and has written about sports, arts and entertainment, architecture, and real estate. He also reviews books for <i>Publishers Weekly,</i> the <i>Globe</i>, the <i>Phoenix</i>, and <i>SPORT</i>. His two newest ventures are <i>Inside NASCAR</i> and writing for MSNBC's website. <br>Nothing bores a golfer more than listening to another golfer relate his greatest round, shot by shot. Sports journalist and author McCullough (My Greatest Day in Baseball, 1946-1997; My Greatest Day in NASCAR) has recorded the recollections of 25 of the best from the last half-century of the game, including Tommy Bolt, Lee Elder, Ray Floyd, Steve Melnyk, Arnold Palmer and Calvin Peete but even the greatest golfers do not make the best raconteurs. Often, the golfers fail to remember all the details (and as editor, McCullough disappointingly fails to fill in the gaps). A lot of the drama is lost, and the stories fall flat. A stellar exception is Jack Nicklaus's vivid retelling of his win at the 1986 Masters (excerpted from his autobiography). Avid golfers who are also careful readers may pick up tips to improve their game strategy, but much depends on their familiarity with a particular course, as Nick Price demonstrates with his recollection of playing the 16th at Ternberry, the hole that won him the 1982 British Open: "I hit a good driver down the middle of the fairway, and I had about eighty-eight yards, and the pin was in a very, very, very precarious placement. It was just over on the left-hand side, and it was just over a berm. I don't know how familiar you are with the hole, but there's a berm, and anything that is short would just roll back into the berm, and that was a five, maybe even a six." The most satisfying parts of the book are the champions' thoughts on the state of the game. Lee Elder comments on blacks in golf then and now, Hale Irwin talks about golfers' changing attitudes, Steve Melnyk considers the hacker versus the pro and all of them reflect on being treated differently after winning a big tournament.

Maxwell was a romantic, self-destructive adventurer, brave and handsome, with a deep sympathy for the underdog, a wonderfully curious mind, and a dogged commitment to discovering the truth. He was most famous for his trilogy of books set in the coast of Scotland, including A Ring of Bright Water, which showed his affinity with nature and a love of wild things, most especially otters. The author was a trusted friend of Maxwell&#39;s as well as a fellow explorer-traveler-writer, and the book reads like a most unusual and eccentric adventure story.</p><p>Douglas Botting was a trusted friend of Gavin Maxwell in the last 12 years of his life and a fellow explorer-traveller-writer, so was uniquely equipped to understand both the creative and destructive demons that drove him. He has created an empathetic study of a man, which reads like the most bizarre and eccentric adventure story, for that is what it is.&#39;Totally absorbing, wonderfully written.

Also in spring, Ashley and her mother stroll through the woods and visit the New York Botanical Garden. A gentle delight in growing things percolates through the sunshiny full-color photographs. Ashley is relaxed and unself-conscious before the camera and is as much a subject as the growing plants. A few sentences are scattered among the photographs, many of which are full-page. The text is secondary to the competent--but not outstanding--photographs, which are only loosely connected to each other. This is not a straightforward treatment of the subject addressed directly to young readers. It doesn't give tips on growing, except incidentally. A pleasant but nonessential evocation of middle-class suburban gardening, suitable for large collections--where relevant. --Sharon Levin, Univ . of Vermont, Burlington<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Gift of ADHD Activity Book: 101 Ways to Turn Your Child&#39;s Problems into Strengths (Companion)</h2><p><p>So much depends on how you look at things: Are you a glass-half-empty person, or do you discover advantages where other people find only weaknesses?

When a Christian count appears at Hannah's door in the Jewish ghetto imploring her to attend his labouring wife, who is nearing death, Hannah is forced to make a dangerous decision. Not only is it illegal for Jews to render medical treatment to Christians, it's also punishable by torture and death. Moreover, as her Rabbi angrily points out, if the mother or child should die, the entire ghetto population will be in peril. <br><br>But Hannah&#x2019;s compassion for another woman&#x2019;s misery overrides her concern for self-preservation. The Rabbi once forced her to withhold care from her shunned sister, Jessica, with terrible consequences. Hannah cannot turn away from a labouring woman again. Moreover, she cannot turn down the enormous fee offered by the Conte. Despite the Rabbi&#x2019;s protests, she knows that this money can release her husband, Isaac, a merchant who was recently taken captive on Malta as a slave. There is nothing Hannah wants more than to see the handsome face of the loving man who married her despite her lack of dowry, and who continues to love her despite her barrenness. She must save Isaac.<br><br>Meanwhile, far away in Malta, Isaac is worried about Hannah&#x2019;s safety, having heard tales of the terrifying plague ravaging Venice. But his own life is in terrible danger. He is auctioned as a slave to the head of the local convent, Sister Assunta, who is bent on converting him to Christianity. When he won&#x2019;t give up his faith, he&#x2019;s traded to the brutish lout Joseph, who is renowned for working his slaves to death. Isaac soon learns that Joseph is heartsick over a local beauty who won&#x2019;t give him the time of day. Isaac uses his gifts of literacy and a poetic imagination&#x2014;not to mention long-pent-up desire&#x2014;to earn his day-to-day survival by penning love letters on behalf of his captor and a paying illiterate public. <br><br>Back in Venice, Hannah packs her &#x201c;"birthing spoons&#x201d;&#x2014;secret rudimentary forceps she invented to help with difficult births&#x2014;and sets off with the Conte and his treacherous brother. Can she save the mother? Can she save the baby, on whose tiny shoulders the Conte&#x2019;s legacy rests? And can she also save herself, and Isaac, and their own hopes for a future, without endangering the lives of everyone in the ghetto?<br><br><b>The Midwife of Venice</b> is a gripping historical page-turner, enthralling readers with its suspenseful action and vivid depiction of life in sixteenth-century Venice.

The creations of women are transitory &#x2014; meals cooked, clothes mended, clothes washed, clothes sold (for one of the few professions Jews were permitted at the time was trade in second hand clothing), children born, children birthed, and children raised. After that trip, I started to read all I could find on the subject of daily life in the ghetto. There is precious little. And precious little about the daily lives of women in particular and how they gave birth.

The Ponte di Ghetto Nuovo, the bridge that leads to the ghetto, trembles under the weight of sacks of rotting vegetables, rancid fat, and vermin. Shapeless matter, perhaps animal, floats to the surface of Rio di San Girolamo and hovers on its greasy waters. Through the mist rising from the canal the cries and grunts of foraging pigs echo. Seeping refuse on the streets renders the pavement slick and the walking treacherous.<br><br>It was on such a night that the men came for Hannah. She heard their voices, parted the curtains, and tried to peer down into the <i>campo</i> below. Without the charcoal brazier heating her room, thick ice had encrusted the inside of the window and obscured her view. Warming two coins on her tongue, grimacing from the bitter metallic taste, she pressed them to the glass with her thumbs until they melted a pair of eyeholes through which she could stare. Two figures, three storeys below, argued with Vicente, whose job it was to lock the gates of the Ghetto Nuovo at sunset and unlock them at sunrise. For a <i>scudo</i>, he guided men to Hannah&#x2019;s dwelling. This time, Vicente seemed to be arguing with the two men, shaking his head, emphasizing his words by waving about a pine torch, which cast flickering light on their faces.<br>&nbsp;<br>Men often called for her late at night&#x2014;it was the nature of her profession&#x2014;but these men were out of place in the ghetto in a way she could not immediately put into words. Stealing a look through the protection of the eyeholes, she saw that one was tall, barrel-chested, and wore a cloak trimmed with fur. The other was shorter, stouter, and dressed in breeches of a silk far too thin for the chill of the night air. The lace on the tall man&#x2019;s cuff fluttered like a preening dove as he gestured toward her building.<br><br>Even through the window, she could hear him say her name in the back of his throat, the <i>h </i>in Hannah like <i>ch</i>, sounding like an Ashkenazi Jew. His voice ricocheted off the narrow, knife-shaped ghetto buildings that surrounded the <i>campo</i>. But something was wrong. It took her a moment to realize what was odd about the two strangers.<br><br>They wore black hats. All Jews, by order of the Council of Ten, were obliged to wear the scarlet <i>berete</i>, to symbolize Christ&#x2019;s blood shed by the Jews. These Christians had no right to be in the ghetto at midnight, no reason to seek her services.<br><br>But maybe she was too quick to judge. Perhaps they sought her for a different purpose altogether. Possibly they brought news of her husband. Perhaps, may God be listening, they had come to tell her that Isaac lived and was on his way home to her.<br><br>Months ago, when the Rabbi informed her of Isaac&#x2019;s capture, she was standing in the same spot where these men stood now, near the wellhead, drawing water for washing laundry. She had fainted then, the oak bucket dropping from her arms onto her shoe. Water soaked the front of her dress and cascaded onto the paving stones. Her friend Rebekkah, standing next to her under the shade of the pomegranate tree, had caught Hannah by the arm before she struck her head on the wellhead. Such had been her grief that not until several days later did she realize her foot was broken.<br><br>The men moved closer. They stood beneath her window, shivering in the winter cold. In Hannah&#x2019;s <i>loghetto</i>, dampness stained the walls and ceiling grey-brown. The coverlet that she had snatched from the bed and wrapped around her shoulders to keep out the chill of the night clung to her, holding her in a soggy embrace. She hiked it higher around her, the material heavy with her nightmares, traces of Isaac&#x2019;s scent, and oil from the skins of oranges. He had been fond of eating oranges in bed, feeding her sections as they chatted. She had not washed the blanket since Isaac had departed for the Levant to trade spices. One night he would return, steal into their bed, wrap his arms around her, and again call her his little bird. Until then, she would keep to her side of the bed, waiting.&nbsp; <br><br>She slipped on her loose-fitting <i>ciopp� </i>with the economical movements of a woman accustomed to getting ready in haste, replaced the coverlet over her bed, and smoothed it as though Isaac still slumbered beneath. <br><br>While she waited for the thud of footsteps and the blows on the door, she lit the charcoal brazier, her fingers so awkward with cold and nervousness that she had difficulty striking the flint against the tinder box. The fire smouldered, then flared and burned, warming the room until she could no longer see clouds of her breath in the still air. From the other side of the wall, she heard the gentle snoring of her neighbours and their four children.&nbsp; <br><br>Peering through the eyeholes, now melting from the heat of her body, she stared. The tall man, his voice strident, pivoted on his heel and strode toward her building; the stout man trotted behind, managing two steps for each one of the tall man&#x2019;s. She held her breath and willed Vicente to tell them what they wanted of her was impossible.&nbsp; <br><br>To soothe herself, she stroked her stomach, hating the flatness of it, feeling the delicate jab of her pelvic bones through her nightdress. She felt slightly nauseated and for a joyful moment experienced a flicker of hope, almost like the quickening of a child. But it was the smell of the chamber pot and the mildew of the walls playing havoc with her stomach, not pregnancy. She was experiencing her courses now, and would purify herself next week in the <i>mikvah</i>, the ritual bath that would remove all traces of blood.<br><br>Soon she felt vibrations on the rickety stairs and heard mumbled voices approaching her door. Hannah wrapped her arms around herself, straining to hear. They called her name as they pounded on the door, which made her want to dive into bed, pull the covers over her head, and lie rigid. From the other side of the wall, her neighbour, who had delivered twins last year and needed her rest, rapped for quiet.<br><br>Hannah twisted her black hair into a knot at the back of her head, secured it with a hairpin. Before they could burst through the entrance, she flung open the door, about to shout to Vicente for assistance. But her hand flew to her mouth, stifling a cry of surprise. Between the two Christian men, pale as a scrap of parchment, stood the Rabbi.&nbsp; Hannah backed into her room.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rabbi Ibraiham kissed his figers and reached up to touch the <i>mezzuzah</i>, the tiny box containing Scripture fastened to the right-hand side of her door jamb. &#x201c;<i>Shalom Aleichem </i>and forgive us, Hannah, for disturbing you.&#x201d; The Rabbi had dressed in haste; the fringe of his prayer shawl dangled unevenly around his knees, his yarmulke askew. &#x201c;<i>Aleichem shalom</i>,&#x201d; she replied. She started to put a hand on the Rabbi&#x2019;s arm but stopped herself just in time. A woman was not to touch a man outside of her family, even when not having her monthly flow.<br><br>&#x201c;These men need to talk with you. May we come in?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah averted her eyes as she always did in the presence of a man other than Isaac. They should not enter. She was not properly dressed; her room could not contain all four of them.<br><br>In a voice pitched higher than normal, she asked the Rabbi, &#x201c;Your wife is better? I heard she was suffering from the gout and has been in bed since last Shabbat.&#x201d; <br><br>The Rabbi was stooped, his clothes redolent with the fusty odour of a man lacking a healthy wife to air them and ensure he did not sit hunched all night reading over beeswax candles. Perhaps, Hannah thought, Rivkah had finally gone to the Jewish quarter in Rome to live with their eldest son, as she had often threatened.&nbsp; <br><br>The Rabbi shrugged. &#x201c;Rivkah&#x2019;s hands and feet remain immobile, but, alas, not her tongue. Her words remain as cutting as a sword.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that.&#x201d;<br><br>The Rabbi&#x2019;s marital troubles were not a secret from anyone in the ghetto within earshot of their apartment. He and Rivkah had not enjoyed a peaceful moment in their forty years together.<br><br>&#x201c;Gentlemen, this is our midwife, Hannah. May she be blessed above all women.&#x201d; The Rabbi bowed. &#x201c;Hannah, this is Conte Paolo di Padovani and his brother Jacopo. May God his rock protect them and grant them long life. The Conte insisted that I bring him to you. He asks for our help.&#x201d; Our help? Hannah thought. Did <i>she</i> deliver sermons?<br><br>Did the Rabbi deliver babies?<br><br>&#x201c;But as I have explained to the Conte,&#x201d; said the Rabbi, &#x201c;what he asks is not possible. You are not permitted to assist Christian women in childbirth.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Only last Sunday in the Piazza San Marco, Fra Bartolome, the Dominican priest, had railed against Christians receiving medical treatment from Jews, or as he phrased it, &#x201c;from enemies of the Cross.&#x201d; <br><br>The Conte tried to interrupt, but the Rabbi held up a finger. &#x201c;Papal dispensation, you are going to tell me? Not for a humble midwife like Hannah.&#x201d;<br><br>This time it seemed the Rabbi was on Hannah&#x2019;s side. They had common cause in refusing the Conte&#x2019;s request.&nbsp; <br><br>The Conte looked to be in his fifties, at least twice Hannah&#x2019;s age. Fatigue showed in his hollowed cheeks, making him appear as old as the Rabbi. His brother, perhaps ten years younger, was soft and not as well made, with sloping shoulders and narrow chest. The Conte nodded at her and pushed past the Rabbi into the room, ducking his head to avoid scraping it on the slanted ceiling. He was large, in the fashion of Christians, and florid from eating roasted meats. Hannah tried to slow her breathing. There seemed to be not enough air in the room for all of them.&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;I am honoured to meet you,&#x201d; he said, removing his black hat. His voice was deep and pleasant, and he spoke the sibilant Veneziano dialect of the city. <br><br>Jacopo, his brother, was immaculate, his chubby cheeks well powdered, not a spot of mud disgracing his breeches. He entered warily, placing one foot ahead of the other as though he expected the creaky floor to give way under him. He made a half bow to Hannah.<br><br>The Conte unfastened his cloak and glanced around her <i>loghetto</i>, taking in the trestle bed, the stained walls, the pine table, and the menorah. The stub of a beeswax candle in the corner guttered, casting shadows around the small room.&nbsp; Clearly, he had never been inside such a modest dwelling, and judging by his stiff posture and the way he held himself away from the walls, he was not comfortable being in one now.<br><br>&#x201c;What brings you here tonight?&#x201d; Hannah asked, although she knew full well. The Rabbi should not have led the men to her home. He should have persuaded them to leave. There was nothing she could do for them.&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;My wife is in travail,&#x201d; said the Conte. He stood shifting his weight from one leg to the other. His mouth was drawn, his lips compressed into a thin white line.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>The brother, Jacopo, hooked a foot around a stool and scraped it over the floor toward him. He flicked his handkerchief over the surface and then sat, balancing one buttock in the air.<br><br>The Conte continued to stand. &#x201c;You must help her.&#x201d; <br><br>Hannah had always found it difficult to refuse aid to anyone, from a wounded bird to a woman in childbirth. &#x201c;I feel it is a great wrong to decline, sir.&#x201d; Hannah glanced at the Rabbi. &#x201c;If the law permitted, I would gladly assist, but as the Rabbi explained, I cannot.&#x201d;<br><br>The Conte&#x2019;s eyes were blue, cross-hatched with a network of fine lines, but his shoulders were square and his back erect. How different he appeared from the familiar men of the ghetto, pale and stooped from bending over their secondhand clothing, their gemstones, and their Torah.<br><br>&#x201c;My wife has been labouring for two days and two nights. The sheets are soaked with her blood, yet the child will not be born.&#x201d; He gave a helpless wave of his hand. &#x201c;I do not know where else to turn.&#x201d;<br><br>His was the face of a man suffering for his wife&#x2019;s pain; Hannah felt a stab of compassion. Difficult confinements were familiar to her. The hours of pain. The child that presented shoulder first. The child born dead. The mother dying of milk fever.<br><br>&#x201c;I am so sorry, sir. You must love your wife very much to venture into the ghetto to search me out.&#x201d; &#x201c;Her screams have driven me from my home. I cannot bear to be there any longer. She pleads for God to end her misery.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Many labours end well, even after two days,&#x201d; Hannah said. &#x201c;God willing, she will be fine and deliver you a healthy son.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is the natural course of events,&#x201d; the Rabbi said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Does not the Book of Genesis say, &#x2018;In pain are we brought forth&#x2019;?&#x201d; He turned to Hannah. &#x201c;I already told him you would refuse, but he insisted on hearing it from your own lips.&#x201d; He opened his mouth to say more, but the Conte motioned for him to be silent. To Hannah&#x2019;s surprise, the Rabbi obeyed.<br><br>The Conte said, &#x201c;Women speak of many things among themselves. My wife, Lucia, tells me that although you are young, you are the best midwife in Venice&#x2014;Christian or Jew. They say you have a way of coaxing stubborn babies out of their mothers&#x2019; bellies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do not believe everything you hear,&#x201d; Hannah said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Even a blind chicken finds a few grains of corn now and again.&#x201d; She looked at his large hands, nervously clasping each other to keep from trembling. &#x201c;There are Christian midwives just as skilled.&#x201d;<br><br>But he was right. There was no <i>levatrice </i>in Venice who was as gifted as she. The babies emerged quickly and the mothers recovered more speedily when Hannah attended their <i>accouchements</i>. Only the Rabbi understood the reason, and he could be trusted to keep silent, knowing that if anyone discovered her secret she would be branded as a witch and subjected to torture.<br><br>&#x201c;Now from her own lips you have heard,&#x201d; said the Rabbi. &#x201c;Let us depart. She cannot help you.&#x201d; He gave a brief nod to Hannah and turned to leave. &#x201c;I am sorry to have disturbed you. Go back to sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacopo clapped his hands together as though they were covered with dirt, rose from the stool, and started toward the door. &#x201c;Let us go, <i>mio fratello</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>But the Conte remained. &#x201c;I would bear Lucia&#x2019;s pain myself if it were possible. I would give my blood to replace hers, which as we waste time talking is pooling on the floor of her bedchamber.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah&#x2019;s eyes were level with the buttons of his cloak. As he spoke, he swayed from fatigue. She took a step back, afraid he would topple on her.<br>&nbsp;<br>She lowered her voice and said to the Rabbi in Yiddish, &#x201c;Is it unthinkable that I go? Although Jewish physicians are forbidden to attend Christian patients, they often do. Christians needing to be purged or bled turn a blind eye to the Pope&#x2019;s edict. Many Jewish doctors are summoned under the darkness of night and slip past sleeping porters. They say even the Doge himself has a Jewish physician . . .&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Such tolerance would never extend to a woman,&#x201d; the Rabbi replied. &#x201c;If a Christian baby was, God forbid, to die at birth, and a Jewish midwife was attending, she would be blamed. And along with her, the entire ghetto.&#x201d; The Rabbi turned to the Conte and said, speaking again in Veneziano, &#x201c;There are many Christian midwives in ...</p><h2>Icehole</h2><p>Buried deep under the ice of Antarctica is something that interests the U.S. government.

Kaufman, Damon Runyon, Walter Winchell, and &#x201c;the Queen of the Nightclubs,&#x201d; Texas Guinan; bards like A. J. Liebling, Joe Mitchell, and the Beats, who celebrated the drug dealers and pimps of 42nd Street. He describes Times Square&#x2019;s notorious collapse into pathology and the fierce debates over how best to restore it to life.<br><br>Traub then goes on to scrutinize today&#x2019;s Times Square as no author has yet done. He writes about the new 42nd Street, the giant Toys &#x201c;R&#x201d; Us store with its flashing Ferris wheel, the new world of corporate theater, and the sex shops trying to leave their history behind.<br>More than sixty years ago, Liebling called Times Square &#x201c;the heart of the world&#x201d;&#x2014;not just the center of the world, though this crossroads in Midtown Manhattan was indeed that, but its heart. From the dawn of the twentieth century through the 1950s, Times Square was the whirling dynamo of American popular culture and, increasingly, an urban sanctuary for the eccentric and the untamed. The name itself became emblematic of the tremendous life force of cities everywhere.<br><br>Today, Times Square is once again an awe-inspiring place, but the dark and strange corners have been filled with blazing light. The most famous street character on Broadway, &#x201c;the Naked Cowboy,&#x201d; has his own website, and Toys &#x201c;R&#x201d; Us calls its flagship store in Times Square &#x201c;the toy center of the universe.&#x201d; For the giant entertainment corporations that have moved to this safe, clean, and self-consciously gaudy spot, Times Square is still very much the center of the world. But is it still the heart?</p><p><b>JAMES TRAUB</b> has been writing about the politics, culture, characters, and institutions of New York City for twenty-five years.

THE CHILDREN OF NECESSITY<br><br>The word "square" does not have the same meaning in Manhattan as in Paris or London or Rome. Belgrave Square and the Piazza della Repubblica are rectilinear spaces that serve as punctuations or pauses in the street plan. Here the business and the pace of the city slows, cars are forced to the periphery, and pedestrians are invited to wander across broad spaces, often around and amidst a garden. Think of the Place des Vosges, that quintessential seventeenth-century square in the heart of Paris, with its grand brick-faced houses and elegant caf�s looking out over a park where schoolchildren in uniform play on swings. This is the Paris of Madeline, and of our dreams.<br><br>New York City has, or rather had, several such gracious spots, in the districts developed in the nineteenth century-Washington Square, in Greenwich Village; Gramercy Park, in the East Twenties. But most of the places New Yorkers call squares are, in fact, axial points where Broadway crosses another north-south avenue. Some of those places, including Union Square, at 14th Street, and Madison Square, at 23rd, also featured charmingly landscaped parks, with fine houses gathered around the perimeter; but because they were also traffic hubs, these places eventually became large-scale commercial centers, so that New Yorkers now think of them as places to shop rather than to stroll. And as Broadway continues north it slices straight through the adjacent avenue, putting an end both to parks and to pedestrians. The square immediately to the north of Madison is Herald Square, which consists of a triangle of weeds, a statue of Horace Greeley, and an enormous number of cars. The next square after that is Times Square, which is neither square nor safe to cross by foot, and which is possibly the least serene place in the Western Hemisphere-"a ganglion of streets that fuses into a traffic cop," as the essayist and urban bard Benjamin de Casseres put it in 1925. Is it any wonder that our dreams of Paris are so different from our dreams of New York, when the one has the Place des Vosges, and the other Times Square?<br><br>Why does Manhattan have traffic jams where other cities have plazas? A reasonable guess would be that the sheer force of growth wiped the old gathering spots off the map. That would be reasonable; but it would be wrong. The curious truth is that Manhattan looks the way it does because it was designed that way. Possibly the unlikeliest aspect of this fact is that Manhattan was designed at all. Whereas political capitals, whether Washington, D.C., or Rawalpindi, have often developed according to a blueprint, mercantile centers normally expand willy-nilly from some original core, according to the ambitions and appetites of the people who shape them. And this was certainly true at first of Manhattan, which expanded northward from the tip of the island. The narrow, crooked lanes around Wall Street offer a reminder of what the entire city once looked like.<br><br>But Manhattan's street plan is, in fact, a monument to political control of private behavior. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Manhattan was a flourishing port city of perhaps 100,000 souls which extended about as far north as the stream that is now Canal Street. The farmland beyond was controlled by large landlords, who often carved out private streets for their own convenience. It was by no means clear whether the power to map out the rapidly growing city belonged to the municipal governing body, the Common Council, or to private landowners. In 1807, the city appealed to the state to settle the issue, and the state agreed to appoint a commission that would have "exclusive power to lay out streets, roads and public squares," and to "shut up" streets already built by private parties.<br><br>Whatever the original intention, the commissioners chose to interpret their charge as a mandate to utterly transform the map of the city. In 1811, they published one of the most audacious documents in the history of urban planning. It was a work that bore the stamp of the new republic-though it was Benjamin Franklin's rationalism and unsentimental materialism, rather than Thomas Jefferson's sense of romance and grandeur, that infused this extraordinary design. In remarks accompanying the plan, the commissioners noted that they had wondered "whether they should confine themselves to rectilinear and rectangular streets, or whether they should adopt some of those supposed improvements, by circles, ovals and stars, which certainly embellish a plan, whatever may be their effects as to convenience and utility." Note the stacked deck-on the one hand, "embellishments" of "supposed" value; on the other, "convenience and utility." "In considering that subject," the commissioners continued, "they could not but bear in mind that a city is to be composed principally of the habitations of men, and that strait-sided, right-angled homes are the most cheap to build, and the most convenient to live in. The effect of these plain and simple reflections was decisive."<br><br>So the commissioners straightened out Manhattan's twisty street plan into a relentless, unvarying grid-twelve avenues, placed at unequal intervals and running on a roughly north-south axis, and 155 streets crossing the avenues from the settled northern border of the city far up into the wilds of Harlem. As there were to be no ovals or stars, so there were to be no plazas, no public gathering spots. The commissioners went on to observe, "It may be, to many, a matter of surprise that so few vacant spaces have been left, and these so small, for the benefit of fresh air, and consequent preservation of health. Certainly, if the city of New York were destined to stand on the side of a small stream, such as the Seine or the Thames, a great number of ample places might be needful." Pity Paris or London, languishing beside "a small stream," while in Manhattan the health-giving sea dispelled the vapors attendant upon urban life. And then the commissioners returned to their commercial preoccupations: the very fact that Manhattan was an island, they noted, ensured that the price of land was "uncommonly great"; so "principles of economy" would have to be given more weight than might otherwise have been prudent. Thus, no plazas.<br><br>Generations of urban thinkers, from Frederick Law Olmsted to Lewis Mumford, have reeled in horror at a master plan that obliterated topography in favor of the endless multiplication of identical units, and could find no larger rationale for doing so than cost. And yet everything about the plan bears the stamp of this new democratic republic: its simplicity and horror of adornment; its blunt practicality; its faith in the marketplace as a democratic instrument, equally open to all. The grid was a blow against the large landholder with his private streets; even the decision to identify the avenues and streets by number rather than name was an act of "lexicographical leveling," removing from the great families the privilege of memorializing themselves in the city's street plan. The grid was an abstraction, but an abstraction placed at the service of the citizen-intended not to thwart the city's appetites and ambitions, but to facilitate their satisfaction.<br><br>The commissioners did permit several interruptions in the pattern. There would be "places," such as Union Place, formed at the conjunction of various streets and thus "the children of necessity," and "squares," large areas to be set aside for parade grounds or marketplaces, though not for strolling or the taking of fresh air. Besides these, only one exception to the relentless principle of the grid would be permitted: Broadway. This boulevard was already the city's main street, crossing over the canal and running all the way to Grace Church at 10th Street (where it formed the southern boundary of Union Place). The path continued as the Bloomingdale Road; as it slanted northward, this roadway cut at a sharp angle through the avenues, forming triangles which, though children of necessity as well, apparently seemed to the commissioners too unimportant for further comment.<br><br>the "squares" never had a chance before the city's growth, and before the simple principle-which the commissioners seem to have anticipated-that land would be converted to its most valuable use. Neither the parade ground nor the marketplace was ever built. And as New York became, first, the great port city of the eastern seaboard, and then the nation's chief source of capital, the city's boundary pressed out into the numbered streets of the new grid. The grid did not, of course, lend itself to the idea of a "city center"; instead, the center moved steadily north, from the area around City Hall, to what is now SoHo, to Washington Square. In 1832, a developer gained control over the waste area the commissioners had laid out as Union Place, and renamed it, in the great tradition of real estate marketing, Union Square. By the late 1840s, Union Square was lined with fine houses and shops. The opening up of Madison Avenue in 1847, with its headwaters at Madison Square at 26th Street, made possible a new elite neighborhood; and soon the rich were moving northward along Madison and Fifth.<br><br>New York City underwent a radical transformation in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. An economic boom turned lower Manhattan into one of the world's great commercial centers, with buildings that, for the first time, towered above the highest church steeples. Eight- and ten-story office buildings went up at the tip of the island; the offices of the city's great newspapers clustered around City Hall; wholesalers and small-scale manufacturers moved into cast-iron buildings in the area around Houston Street, and printers and publishers gathered around Astor Place, just below Grace Church. The tremendous growth of downtown propelled ...</p><h2>Harmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children from Sex</h2><p>Now available in paperback, Judith Levine&#39;s controversial book challenges American attitudes towards child and adolescent sexuality-especially attitudes promulgated by a Christian right that has effectively seized control of how sex is taught in public schools. The author-a thoughtful and persuasive journalist and essayist-examines the consequences of &#34;abstinence&#34; only education and its concomitant association of sex with disease, and the persistent denial of pleasure. She notes the trend toward pathologizing young children&#39;s eroticized play and argues that Americans should rethink the boundaries we draw in protecting our children from sex. This powerful and illuminating work was nominated for the 2003 Los Angeles Times Book Prize.</p><p>"In America today, it is nearly impossible to publish a book that says children and teenagers can have sexual pleasure and be safe too," writes journalist Levine (My Enemy, My Love). Levine has somehow pulled that off. Western European countries assume that "sexual expression is a healthy and happy part of growing up"; thus Levine argues that sex is not necessarily bad for minors, and that puritanical attitudes often backfire. According to her, as the age of sexual initiation drops in America, the age of consent is rising. She observes that most so-called pedophiles are attracted to teenagers rather than kids an important subtlety recently aired in the media. (Still, her call for common sense on pedophilia is marred by an inadequate acknowledgment of the extent of online child porn, as documented in Philip Jenkins's recent Beyond Tolerance.) She notes the disturbing trend toward pathologizing young children's eroticized play and criticizes mainstream America for letting the Christian right steer sex education toward an emphasis on abstinence. Compounding that, she says, the right wing has expunged abortion discussions. A Ms. and Nerve.com contributor, Levine argues, contra Mary Pipher (Reviving Ophelia), that love may ruin teenage girls more than sex. At one point, Levine cogently contends that the term "normal" is "subjective and protean"; she prefers "normative," which means "what most people do." It's a good start to confronting some vital questions. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Journalist and free-speech activist Levine (My Enemy, My Love: Women, Men, and the Dilemmas of Gender) here argues that trying to protect young people from sex can actually exacerbate or even create the much-feared sexual danger. Her well-documented horror stories of zealotry and incompetence are chilling; Levine is particularly good at showing that abstinence-based sex education leaves many teens without the information they need to make intelligent choices. Misrepresentations of fact, unfounded assumptions, the runaway media hype offered by so-called experts, conservative agendas, and simple conformity, she writes, largely determine our approaches to censorship, "the pedophile panic," youthful sexual behavior, sex education, abortion, and the suppression of information about sexual pleasure. These factors, she holds, predispose young people to have bad sex with unwanted outcomes. Instead of overreaction and overprotection, adults need to saturate their children's world with accurate, realistic information and images of love and sex, including sexual pleasure. Her book, which provoked considerable controversy even before its publication, provides no easy answers to a complex question but is highly recommended as a wake-up call.

He lives in Washington, D.C., and Palm Beach, Florida.<p>1</p> <p>In the predawn hours of March 3, 2009, Tonya Hatfield huddled outside the darkened home of the United States Supreme Court. A late-winter storm had fallen on Washington, D.C., dropping eight inches of snow on a city expecting cherry blossoms. Crews had shoveled snow from around the court, and Hatfield climbed the forty-four steps to the main entrance, where three others were already in line, hoping to attend the court&#x2019;s morning session.</p> <p>Forty-year-old Hatfield wore a heavy coat and leather gloves but nothing to protect her feet from the temperature, which hovered near zero. In her haste to drive north from her home in southern West Virginia before the snow made the roads impassable, she had forgotten her winter boots, and her toes went numb in her shoes.</p> <p>Hatfield had traveled to Washington only once before, as an eleventh-grader with an exalted vision of American democracy. She was a coal miner&#x2019;s daughter who had been raised to believe that when everything else failed, a courtroom was the one place where the poorest could find justice against the richest and the most powerful. That belief had driven Hatfield from her home in Gilbert, West Virginia (population 417), to study at the University of Kentucky College of Law. Degree in hand, she&#x2019;d returned home to set up her law practice in Gilbert. For the most part, she handled small personal injury cases, real estate closings, lots of wills, and other legal issues.</p> <p>Hatfield wanted to use the law to help those who needed help most and to bring them true justice. But every time one of her cases brushed against the powerful and the well placed, she saw that in Mingo County the coal companies so effectively controlled the political system that overwhelming injustice and corruption were inevitable. For the young lawyer, it was one futile fight after another, and Hatfield had been thinking of giving up the law. That was when she&#x2019;d met Pittsburgh attorney Bruce E. Stanley, who became her co-counsel in a case involving the death of two miners in a mine run by the Massey Energy Company, the largest and most powerful coal company in Appalachia.</p> <p>The West Virginia&#x2013;born Stanley had so inspired Hatfield that she had not only kept her practice but, this morning, had driven 360 miles through a snowstorm to hear another of his cases involving Massey. It was Stanley&#x2019;s first visit to the court, too, but as a counsel of record, he would breeze through the building&#x2019;s mammoth doors. Hatfield, however, had not wanted to bother Stanley for a pass to the hearing, scheduled for 10:00 a.m. She would take her chances in line with the others.</p> <p>As dawn arrived, Hatfield looked up at the Vermont-marble fa�ade of the four-story court and saw the inscription &#x201c;equal justice under law.&#x201d; She could hardly believe that, if she were lucky enough to get in, she would watch the justices apply those words to her friend&#x2019;s case. It could redefine judicial conduct not only in West Virginia&#x2019;s often coal-beholden legal system but in every court in the land.</p> <p><br>Two miles from the shivering Hatfield, Theodore B. Olson drove through the city&#x2019;s empty streets. As his vehicle moved through the corridors of power, the sixty-eight-year-old lawyer sat in his thick wool coat reviewing yet again the case he would be arguing before the Supreme Court in a few hours.</p> <p>Olson&#x2019;s mane of chestnut hair had a Reaganesque fullness, without a spot of gray. His face was that of the common man writ large. To a jury, it would have proved seductive. This morning, however, it wouldn&#x2019;t help him; the only jurors Olson would be facing were the court&#x2019;s nine justices. Olson was a man of great public modesty, but he had the fierce ego of a lawyer who practiced the most unforgiving kind of law: at the Supreme Court, lawyers were given precisely a half hour to make their case. Olson, and his clients, lived and died in those few minutes.</p> <p>Ted Olson not only ranked among the top six attorneys in Supreme Court appearances; he had won forty-three of those fifty-four cases. A lifelong conservative, he had etched his place in legal history in the aftermath of the disputed 2000 presidential election. The Berkeley Law graduate had argued before the Supreme Court on behalf of George W. Bush in <i>Bush v. Gore</i>. The decision seating Bush as president made Olson nationally prominent, lionized by Republicans and despised by Democrats. Bush rewarded Olson by naming him solicitor general, the government&#x2019;s top lawyer, whereupon he won eight consecutive victories for the administration in the Supreme Court. If Olson had not been so disliked by Democrats, Bush would likely have nominated him to the Supreme Court.</p> <p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, Olson&#x2019;s wife, Barbara Olson, a lawyer and a prominent conservative commentator on Fox News, boarded American Airlines flight 77 from Washington&#x2019;s Dulles Airport to Los Angeles. The plane had just taken off when Olson&#x2019;s wife called him, saying that hijackers had commandeered the plane. A few minutes later the jet flew into the Pentagon, killing her and everyone else on board, as well as 125 on the ground there. To many who loathed Olson&#x2019;s politics, her death made him seem vulnerably human, even a tragic figure.</p> <p>Olson was now six months away from his sixty-ninth birthday. At many firms he would have become the hoary, revered senior partner, his picture displayed in the boardroom, his duties relegated to winning new business and placating unhappy clients. Yet he remained at the very center of the firm&#x2019;s operations, and he often squared off against lawyers a quarter century or more his junior.</p> <p>As he turned onto stately Connecticut Avenue, Olson kept thinking about what faced him this morning. The case Olson would be arguing today, <i>Caperton v. Massey Coal Company</i>, had been brought to him by two Pittsburgh attorneys, David Fawcett III and Bruce Stanley, who would be sitting next to him as he addressed the justices. Olson preferred cases of historic significance, and this one offered a potentially precedent-setting result. In the preceding eleven years, it had worked its way through two states and three courtrooms, including the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. It had devastated the life of the primary plaintiff and emboldened the ultimate defendant, the most powerful coal baron in the industry&#x2019;s 130-year history in the region.</p> <p>The plaintiff, Hugh Mason Caperton, was the operator of a small coal mine in southwestern Virginia. His business had been driven into bankruptcy by Donald Leon Blankenship, the chairman of Massey Energy, the fourth-largest coal company in America, which in 2008 had recorded coal revenues of $2 billion.</p> <p>The Massey chairman was the unchallenged voice of the industry. There was no coal Blankenship did not covet. As his nearly six thousand workers and their machines chewed up the earth, producing some forty million tons of coal annually, he chewed up his competitors, buying up their bankrupt operations, picking up mines at fire-sale prices, busting the United Mine Workers, and opening scores of nonunion underground and surface mines. Over twenty-eight years at Massey, Blankenship had risen from office manager to autocrat, building the greatest realm of coal Appalachia had ever seen and controlling more than a third of the region&#x2019;s remaining seams of the mineral. At Massey, he says, he &#x201c;learned about, and struggled against, the ignorance and evilness of the United Mine Workers, much of the media, the &#x2018;greeniacs,&#x2019; and much of corporate America.&#x201d;</p> <p>Amid the 1984&#x2013;85 UMW strike against his company, Blankenship had declared, &#x201c;What you have to accept in a capitalist society generally is that it&#x2019;s like a jungle where it&#x2019;s the survival of the fittest. . . . From a business standpoint, it&#x2019;s survival of the most productive, and in the long term the most productive people who benefit.&#x201d;</p> <p>Blankenship considered Hugh Caperton&#x2019;s small mine, in Harman, Virginia, to be the kind of debt-ridden union operation that needed to adapt to Massey&#x2019;s ways&#x2014;or die. Massey companies were known for doing anything to advance their position: using financial leverage with customers, sabotaging competitors, and fighting the union.</p> <p>One of Massey&#x2019;s newly acquired subsidiaries, United, had a subcompany, Wellmore, that had a long-term contract to buy Harman&#x2019;s coal, but Blankenship decided the price was too expensive. So when he saw an opportunity to nullify the contract, he jumped. His meddling destroyed Caperton&#x2019;s company&#x2014;a small sacrifice in Massey&#x2019;s inexorable advance in a free-market, capitalist society where any economic advantage must be exploited.</p> <p>Blankenship warned Caperton that if he were so foolish as to sue Massey, the company had the money and the power to destroy him. But Caperton filed a suit anyway and, with Fawcett and Stanley as his attorneys, won a $50 million jury judgment in Boone County, West Virginia.</p> <p>Blankenship called the verdict &#x201c;a frightening result&#x201d; and appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Three of the court&#x2019;s five members were avowed progressives, and Blankenship, a conservative Republican, had reason to believe that he and his company stood little chance among them. West Virginia, however, is one of thirty-nine states that elect judges, and before Massey&#x2019;s <i>Caperton</i> appeal could be heard, Blankenship had spent more than $3 million to defeat an incumbent liberal Democratic West Virginia supreme court justice who would have likely ruled against him. His money helped elect Brent D. Benjamin, the first Republican to the court in seventy-six years.</p> <p>Despite Blankenship&#x2019;s massive donations, which would indicate a certain conflict of interest, the newly elected judge refused to recuse himself from <i>Caperton</i>. Benjamin joined the court&#x2019;s 3&#x2013;2 majority overturning <i>Caperton</i>&#x2019;s lower-court victory on a narrow technicality, voiding a jury verdict that, with interest, had reached $75 million.</p> <p>The United States is one of the very few countries, including Japan and Switzerland, that elect judges to office. In the eight years before this Supreme Court proceeding, contributions to judicial elections across America had doubled. The money had grown so fast and so large that some experts felt the integrity of the entire American court system might be at stake. The contributions had reached such a magnitude that critics believed they risked breaching the &#x201c;impenetrable bulwark&#x201d; of an independent judiciary, as described by James Madison when he introduced the Bill of Rights in Congress in 1789.</p> <p>The donations had been monitored by the progressive nonprofit Justice at Stake, which works to ensure fair and impartial courts. The organization followed twenty-nine contested elections in the first decade of the twenty-first century. In these contests, 144 groups contributed an average of $473,000 apiece in elections across America. Large donations accounted for more than 40 percent of all judicial campaign funding during the decade. Blankenship had given more money, by far, than any other group or individual in any one judicial contest. Most likely, no individual in American history had ever contributed as much money to one judicial campaign as Blankenship had.</p> <p>Critics argued that these contributors typically did not open their checkbooks to elect thoughtful, independent jurists who would deeply and deliberatively contemplate each decision. Rather, they spent their money to elect judges who thought the way they thought and would vote the way their money dictated. The way Blankenship saw it, he had done no more than what any other freeborn American citizen could have done and had backed up his beliefs with his money.</p> <p>In <i>Caperton</i>, the questions were clearly and vividly defined, and the case would be zealously argued this morning. Was a citizen&#x2019;s constitutional right to due process and a fair trial violated when one side made large contributions to a judge considering the case? Did an ordinary citizen have the right to force a judge to step aside from a case where, because of massive donations to his election, a reasonable person would assume that the judge would likely favor one side?</p> <p>Due process, as established in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, is a fundamental right of every American. It holds that the government has an absolute obligation to afford every citizen legal rights, no matter how rich or poor, no matter their race or religion, no matter how heinous the crime of which they stand accused, and no matter their ability to contribute to a judge&#x2019;s election campaign.</p> <p>If the court ruled that what Blankenship had done was constitutionally permissible, critics of unfettered campaign contributions argued, there would be no stopping him and other wealthy individuals, organizations, and unions from essentially buying elections in states without campaign finance laws. If the Supreme Court ruled that Blankenship had spent too much, people like him would still have their say, but they would not be able to overwhelm other voices. In West Virginia, the impact would be unprecedented if the highest court in the United States rebuked both the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and Blankenship, the most powerful private citizen in Appalachia.</p> <p><br>Olson knew that he would be making the kind of argument before the court that he had rarely made before. Olson&#x2019;s conservative soul mates argued that you could not regulate free speech; if you started tinkering with people&#x2019;s rights to express their views through financial contributions, you were heading down a dark road.</p> <p>Olson&#x2019;s opponent today would be Andrew L. Frey, a New York attorney who had his own stellar record in front of the court. Massey&#x2019;s attorney argued that the West Virginia judge whose integrity was being challenged had not asked Blankenship for money, although he most certainly had, according to an interview Blankenship gave to the <i>New York Times</i> as well as a second witness. The appellate attorney argued, further, that to agree to the petitioner&#x2019;s &#x201c; &#x2018;vague and malleable standard&#x2019; would almost certainly &#x2018;open the gates for a flood of litigation.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p> <p>Olson&#x2019;s closest personal friends on the court, Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice John Roberts, would almost certainly agree and were the most likely votes against him. The three men had marched politically and intellectually together for three decades, and now here was Olson wandering off to the left.</p> <p>Many in Washington found it unthinkable that Olson had decided to argue <i>Caperton</i> simply because of its legal merits. Some felt that Olson had softened ideologically since his wife&#x2019;s death, and that was why he would even consider advocating the progressive arguments in the case. Others credited the attorney&#x2019;s fourth wife, Lady Booth, a tax attorney and liberal Democrat, for his having taken the case. A few opined that Olson, an adept user of the media, had agreed to argue <i>Caperton</i> to cloak himself in a new, more moderate image.</p> <p>But Olson truly saw in Blankenship&#x2019;s and the other disproportionate special-interest contributions to judicial candidates a challenge to the very notion of American justice. In such situations, he did not believe that the decision to recuse could rest simply on the judgment and honor of the individual judge.</p> <p>Olson knew that the odds today in front of the court were not as favorable as they usually were for him. The majority of the justices had been reluctant to hear the case, and he feared that no matter how well he honed his arguments and how eloquently he spoke he might walk away a loser.</p> <p>Olson kept thinking about his strategy until he arrived at the building on Connecticut Avenue housing Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. It was a little after five in the morning w...</p></p><h2>Natural Impressions: Taking an Artistic Path Through Nature</h2><p>Since the beginning of time, artists have looked to nature for inspiration. They have sketched its shapes, admired its colors, painted its textures, and copied its patterns. Natural Impressions offers a unique way to cultivate creativity by making prints directly from natural objects.

IT IS NOT FOR US TO IMPOSE QUALIFICATIONS UPON THE DIVINE OR PRESUME TO GUESS ITS INTENTIONS. <br>(FORMER FIELD MASTER AVU MED &#x2018;TELCAM OF THE SANGHEILI&nbsp; <i>NERU PE&nbsp;</i>&#x2018; <i>ODOSIMA</i>&#x2014;SERVANTS OF THE ABIDING TRUTH&#x2014;ON REVELATIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE FORERUNNERS) <br>FORMER COLONY OF NEW LLANELLI, BRUNEL SYSTEM: JANUARY 2553. <br>It was an ugly bastard, and the temptation to kill it where it stood was almost more than Serin Osman could handle. <br>It was also pretty upset. Its arms flailed as if it was on some passionate Sangheili rant about politics or religion or whatever they played instead of football, its cloverleaf jaws snapping open and shut like a demented gin-trap. Osman watched from the shuttle cargo bay with her rifle resting on the control panel. Matters could get out of hand with a two-and-a-half-meter alien before you knew it. She was ready to drop the thing before it crushed Phillips. <br>He could actually speak their language, even if some of the sounds defied simple human jaws. She wondered what he sounded like to them. He was making mirroring gestures back at the Sangheili, and although she couldn&#x2019;t hear the conversation it seemed to be working. The alien did that odd trick with its split mandibles, pressing the two sides together to mimic a human jaw and trying to force out more articulate sounds. <br>So the hinge-head was mirroring too. It was a good sign.&nbsp; <i>A good sign in a bad deal.</i>&nbsp;No, not a bad deal: a dirty one. Osman stepped down from the bay, careful to keep her rifle close to her leg so she looked prepared but not threatening. Phillips glanced over his shoulder at her, seeming oblivious of the risk. <br> <i>I&#x2019;d never take my eyes off that thing. God, what do they teach these academics about personal safety?</i> <br>She leaned against the hatch frame and waited, glancing at her watch to check Sydney time. Around her, the ruins of New Llanelli felt like a rebuke. The dead tapped her on the shoulder, appalled:&nbsp; <i>And you&#x2019;re talking to these bastards now? On our graves?</i> <br>A shaft of sunlight struck through a break in the clouds and threw up a bright reflection from a lake in the distance.&nbsp; <i>No&nbsp;&#x2026; that&#x2019;s not a lake.</i>&nbsp;Her brain had joined up the dots and made the wrong assumption. She eased her datapad out of her jacket pocket one-handed and checked. There was no body of water for a hundred kilometers on the map in the CAA Factbook. The reflective surface was vitrified sandy soil, mirror-smooth, square hectares of it where there had once been rye and potatoes. <br>When the Covenant glassed a planet, they really did just that. <br>Phillips gestured to get her attention and distracted her from the uncomfortable thought that the planet was making a point to her. He walked over to the shuttle, looking pleased with himself. <br>&#x201c;The Bishop wants a word,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I told him you were the boss woman. His English is pretty good, so play it straight. And don&#x2019;t call him an Elite. Use the proper name. It matters to them.&#x201d; <br>Osman pushed herself away from the bulkhead with her hip. &#x201c;What, like&nbsp; <i>bishop</i>?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ignore that.&#x201d; Phillips&#x2014;Professor Evan Phillips, another respectable academic who&#x2019;d been sucked down into ONI&#x2019;s drain&#x2014;put on his serious face again. &#x201c;They told me he was devout, but I didn&#x2019;t realize&nbsp; <i>how</i>&nbsp;devout.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is that going to be a problem?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Might be a bonus.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, they do tend to stick to a plan.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I meant that he&#x2019;s a fundamentalist. The Abiding Truth. Very,&nbsp; <i>very</i>&nbsp;old tradition of faith.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Prompt me. I&#x2019;m not an anthropologist.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re said to have squirreled away original Forerunner relics from the time of their first contact. Their equivalent of saints&#x2019; fingers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It must be my birthday.&#x201d; Osman wasn&#x2019;t sure when that really was. Today seemed as good a day as any. &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;ve got some schematics in a dusty drawer or something.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come on, don&#x2019;t keep him waiting.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How is he with women? I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever seen a female Sangheili. Do they keep them in purdah or something?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that simple.&#x201d; Phillips beckoned to her to follow. &#x201c;The ladies wield a hell of a lot of political power in the bloodline stakes. When you&#x2019;ve got a few hours to kill, I&#x2019;ll explain it.&#x201d; <br>She didn&#x2019;t, and it could wait. She walked up to the Sangheili, steeling herself not to call him an Elite or a murdering hinge-head bastard. <br>Osman was taller than the average man, and at one-ninety she wasn&#x2019;t used to having to look up at anybody. But the Bishop towered half a meter above her like a monument in gold armor. For a moment she found herself looking into a disturbingly featureless face before she settled on the black eyes and small, flaring nostrils just below them. The Bishop was sniffing her scent. Unsettling didn&#x2019;t even begin to cover it. <br>&#x201c;Captain Osman,&#x201d; Phillips said cautiously, looking back and forth between her and the Sangheili. &#x201c;Let me introduce you to Avu Med &#x2018;Telcam, speaker for the Servants of Abiding Truth. He used to be a field master but he&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; renounced the ways of the infidels and cleansed his name, because they&#x2019;ve brought shame and misery on the Sangheili&nbsp;&#x2026; and they deserve to hang from spikes.&#x201d; He seemed to be quoting very carefully, glancing at the Sangheili as if for confirmation. He gave her a don&#x2019;t-say-anything-daft look. &#x201c;He means the Arbiter.&#x201d; <br>&#x2018;Telcam sniffed again. Osman could smell him, too. It was a faintly leathery scent, like the seats of a new car. It wasn&#x2019;t unpleasant. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Captain Osman. I&#x2019;m a shipmaster.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam would get the point. &#x201c;So I keep my word. May we talk?&#x201d; She gave Phillips her get-lost look. This wasn&#x2019;t for his ears, and that was as much for his own good as Earth&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Can you give us ten minutes, Professor?&#x201d; <br>Phillips nodded and turned to walk away. This was why Osman didn&#x2019;t like using co-opted specialists. If he&#x2019;d known what she was about to do, he would probably have gone all ethical on her. <br> <i>I might be underestimating him, of course. But his job&#x2019;s done. It&#x2019;s not his problem now.</i> <br>&#x2018;Telcam tilted his head to one side. Osman had to strain to make out the words, but it was no harder than concentrating on a bad radio signal. The creature really could speak pretty good English. <br>&#x201c;Shipmaster, my people have been punished because they had no&nbsp; <i>faith,</i>&#x201d; he said. A fine mist of saliva cooled on her face every time he hit a sibilant or an&nbsp; <i>F</i>. It didn&#x2019;t look easy to articulate those four-way jaws. &#x201c;The traitor Thel &#x2018;Vadam and his ilk now say the gods are deceivers, and so they shall die. We have been in thrall to mongrel races long enough. We have let the false prophets of the San&#x2019;Shyuum corrupt our pure connection to the divine. Now we shall do our penance and bring the Sangheili back to the true path. So what can you possibly want with us? Do you want to agree to a truce?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How were you planning on killing &#x2018;Vadam and the other&nbsp;&#x2026; traitors?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We have few ships left now. Few weapons, too. But we have our devotion. We will find a way.&#x201d; <br>Osman noted the energy sword on his belt.&nbsp; <i>We&#x2019;ve got a right one here. A god-bothering, heavily armed maniac. Lovely. I can do business with that.</i>&nbsp;She tried to find genuine common ground in case he could smell fear or deceit on her. A small dash of truth in a soup of lies worked wonders. <br>&#x201c;What if&nbsp; <i>we</i>&nbsp;supplied you with some weapons?&#x201d; <br>He jerked his head back. &#x201c;And why would you do that? The traitor sides with humans against his own.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Humans gamble. I&#x2019;m betting that your side will win. Dead friends aren&#x2019;t much use.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam made a little sound like a horse puffing through its lips. A fine spray rained on her again and she tried not to recoil. She picked up a whiff of something far too much like dog food. &#x201c; <i>Kingmaker.</i>&nbsp;This is your policy. You help us take control so that you know your enemy and think you can then control&nbsp; <i>us.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Look, we&#x2019;re never going to be friends, Field Master. But we can agree to stay out of one another&#x2019;s way and lead separate existences. Too many lives have been lost. It has to stop.&#x201d; <br>&#x2018;Telcam leaned closer again as if he was doing a uniform inspection. &#x201c;You have colonies here. This is part of the war. This is the cause of our enmity.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Some of our colonies don&#x2019;t like us very much either. Humans kill humans too.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How tangled your lives are.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My, you&nbsp; <i>do</i>&nbsp;speak good English.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was a translator once. I interpreted your communications for my old shipmaster. I speak several human languages.&#x201d; <br>Well, that explained a hell of a lot. Phillips obviously didn&#x2019;t know, or at least he hadn&#x2019;t said, but Osman decided to cut him some slack because he&#x2019;d only been tasked to do one thing: to get her an audience with dissident Sangheili who were likely to disrupt any peace deals. He was lucky to get that far without having his head ripped off. <br>&#x201c;Well, Field Master, I think we can help one another keep our troublesome factions in line.&#x201d; Osman turned slightly to keep Phillips in her peripheral vision, just in case he wandered back and heard too much. &#x201c;It might require some discretion, because we can&#x2019;t be seen to ally with you. But an unstable Sangheili empire doesn&#x2019;t help us, and an unstable human one is a threat to you. Yes?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And some of my brethren might not understand my willingness to talk to infidels. So we do favors, you and I.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed. For the greater good.&#x201d; Osman paused a beat and made sure she didn&#x2019;t blink. Sangheili had a military sense of honor, and the truth she was about to drop into the deceit went some way toward satisfying her own. &#x201c;If I thought &#x2018;Vadam would survive as leader, I would be doing deals with him instead.&#x201d; <br>She wasn&#x2019;t sure if Sangheili ever smiled. If they did, she had no idea what it looked like, not with that four-way jaw. But &#x2018;Telcam&#x2019;s expression shifted a little. The muscles in his dog-reptile face relaxed for a moment. <br>&#x201c;I have a condition,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;I thought you might.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You blaspheme about the gods. You spread vile lies about them. This must stop.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We just showed you what the Halo was.&#x201d;&nbsp; <i>Oh shit. Come on, think. There&#x2019;s a way through this.</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t set out to insult your beliefs.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So the Halos are machines of destruction. So you say the gods themselves were killed by them.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam leaned over her, almost nose to nose. He was so close that she couldn&#x2019;t focus on those doglike teeth. They were just cream blurs in a purplish haze of gum. &#x201c; <i>Your</i>&nbsp;god chose to die for you and that is precisely why you revere him, yes? And why you say he also&nbsp; <i>lives.</i>&nbsp;This so-called proof about the Halos means nothing. Not even to&nbsp; <i>you.</i>&#x201d; <br> <i>And he uses the plural. Halos.</i> <br>Osman suspected that he wanted her to agree with him, to reassure him that gods could be both dead and eternal at the same time like some divine Schr�dinger&#x2019;s cat, to put some certainty back in his life. She knew that feeling. But the last thing she wanted was a theological argument with a heavily armed alien four or five times her weight. She bit back a comment that her name was Osman and that he was thinking of someone else&#x2019;s religion. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had scientists who claim they&#x2019;ve disproved the existence of God, and others who argue you can&#x2019;t prove anything,&#x201d; she said carefully. &#x201c;But it hasn&#x2019;t made any difference to any of our religions. Faith is quite separate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then you understand.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam drew back. &#x201c;If you arm us&nbsp;&#x2026; if you stay away from our worlds&nbsp;&#x2026; then when we take power and restore the rightful ways, we will leave you alone.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Deal,&#x201d; she said. She almost held out her hand to shake on the agreement but thought better of it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in touch very soon.&#x201d; <br>The Sangheili just turned and loped away to his ship without another word. It was too easy to look at them and see only an ungainly animal with strangely bovine legs, and not a superior force that had almost brought Earth to its knees. Phillips walked up to her but didn&#x2019;t ask what had happened. His expression said he was bursting to find out. <br>&#x201c;Are we done?&#x201d; <br>Osman nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one enemy we don&#x2019;t have to fight for a while.&#x201d; She gave him a thumbs-up. &#x201c;Well done. I never thought we&#x2019;d get one of them to talk to us, let alone reach an agreement. We owe you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I admit it&#x2019;s satisfying to be able to put the theory into practice. And wonderful to have unique access to Sangheili space with all expenses paid, of course. Good old ONI. My taxes, well spent.&#x201d; <br>Osman headed back to the shuttle, suddenly aware of small fragments of glass crunching under her boots.&nbsp; <i>Damn, that&#x2019;s not broken bottles. It&#x2019;s vitrification.</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t feel your academic cred&#x2019;s been stained by mixing with us grubby little spooks, then.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;God, no. I&#x2019;m not that naive. I know what you&#x2019;re up to. Just don&#x2019;t tell me, that&#x2019;s all. I have to be able to deny it with a straight face.&#x201d; <br>So he certainly wasn&#x2019;t stupid, and ONI wasn&#x2019;t doing anything that countless governments hadn&#x2019;t done over the centuries to look after their interests. She should have expected him to work it out. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re doing what, exactly?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, I thought I was helping you establish diplomatic channels with the hard-to-reach Sangheili demographic.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You told me not to tell you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, so I did.&#x201d; He winked at her. &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ve slapped a saddle on that tiger. Now you better make damn sure you don&#x2019;t fall off.&#x201d; <br>They settled into their seats and she ran the preflight checks before handing over to the AI. Phillips was whistling tunelessly under his breath, as if he was glad to be leaving. Osman had expected him to be reluctant to go home but he obviously had what he wanted&#x2014;some dazzling scientific paper, some award-worthy research, maybe even a lucrative book&#x2014;that nobody else in his field had, and that seemed to be enough. <br>He wouldn&#x2019;t be coming back here. He probably realized that. ONI regarded him as a single-use sharp. <br>&#x201c;Just remember that my enemy&#x2019;s enemy isn&#x2019;t my friend, Professor,&#x201d; she said, opening a secure comms channel. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s my enemy who&#x2019;s just taking a sidebar.&#x201d; <br>Phillips burst out laughing. &#x201c;You sweet, innocent little flower. You&#x2019;ve never worked in academia, have you? Red in tooth and claw. Feuds, plots, vengeance. The works.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can imagine.&#x201d; The secure channel indicator flashed and Osman lowered her voice. &#x201c;Osman here, ma&#x2019;am. Professor Phillips and I are on our way back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you for letting me know, Captain.&#x201d; Admiral Margaret Parangosky, head of the Office of Naval Intelligence, never raised her voice and never needed to. &#x201c;I assume things went well.&#x201d; <br>Osman could translate Parangosky-isms easily enough.&nbsp; <i>Have you set up the Sangheili insurrection?</i>&nbsp;That was what she meant. Few outside the Navy and the senior ranks of government knew who Parangosky was, let alone knew to fear her. Osman suspected she was the only person in the Admiral&#x2019;s circle who would always be forgiven even if she failed. But she wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry to test it. <br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Thank Professor Phillips for me. Safe flight.&#x201d; <br>Osman signed off and the AI took over. The shuttle shuddered on its dampers as its engines reached peak power. In a few hours, they&#x2019;d rendezvous with&nbsp; <i>Battle of Minden</i>&nbsp;and head back to Earth, where the mission would be over for Phillips but only just beginning for her. <br> <i>So far, so good.</i> <br>&#x201c;Do I get a gold star?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;Maybe an extra cookie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the best Turkish restaur...</p><h2>Physical Therapy &amp; Massage for the Horse: A Comprehensive Approach to Equine Kinesiology</h2><p>A unique blend of basic biomechanics and practical physical therapeutic techniques that relieve pain and improve performance in the horse.</p><p>Denoix is a professor of veterinary anatomy; Pailloux a practicing therapistText: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Epic Battles of the Civil War (Historical Comics Marvel, Volume 1: First Bull run) by Willaim Messer-Loebs (1998-05-04)</h2><p>This was the first major batle of the Civil War.

As with the first volume, the retellings are striking in their faithfulness to the spirit of the originals but without their drawbacks of heavy dialect and stereotypical narrator. These are charming, spirited stories. Here, Lester has done what all storytellers aim to do: he has told his stories faithfully while at the same time making them uniquely his own. Pinkney's illustrations are mostly black-and-white pen-and-ink drawings with a few full-color double-page spreads which emphasize the colors of nature. While not as nimble as the A. B. Frost originals, they are still a strong match for Lester's retellings. An outstanding choice for public and school libraries as well as for storytellers. Kay McPherson, Central Atlanta-Fulton Pub .

Mr. McFeeley lives in Van Nuys, California.</p>Grade 1-4-When Grandpa finds Sammy in the barn, the youngster explains that he has been using binoculars to locate God to request a cure for his hospitalized mother's knee problem. He explains that he asked several people where to find God, and each of them had a different answer. "The grocery man showed me his fruits and vegetables and said God was in all growing things. That made me feel funny about eating my salad." Grandpa resolves the child's confusion with precision, wrapping it all up in a nice, neat package for his consumption: "God is helping your mother. He's doing it through the good doctors who are helping her. God is also expecting your mother to help Him help her by doing the exercises she needs to do to make her leg strong." The boy deduces that since God works through all people, He's in Sammy and can be contacted at any time. The lengthy story is convoluted at times and the tone is didactic. The full-page illustrations are done in watercolors and ink. While the adult characters have realistic features, Sammy has large Ping-Pong-ball eyes that give his face a cartoon quality that doesn't fit with the rest of the artwork.<br><i>Linda M.

Although ceramics are most often used for placing the peoples who produced them in time, they can also provide important clues to past economic organization. This volume covers nearly 1000 years of southwestern prehistory and history, focusing on ceramic production in a number of environmental and economic contexts. It brings together the best of current research to illustrate the variation in the organization of production evident in this single geographic area. The contributors use diverse research methods in their studies of vessel form and decoration. All support the conclusion that the specialized production of ceramics for exchange beyond the household was widespread. The first seven chapters focus on ceramic production in specific regions, followed by three essays that re-examine basic concepts and offer new perspectives. Because previous studies of southwestern ceramics have focused more on distribution than production, Ceramic Production in the American Southwest fills a long-felt need for scholars in that region and offers a broad-based perspective unique in the literature. The Southwest lacked high levels of sociopolitical complexity and economic differentiation, making this volume of special interest to scholars working in similar contexts and to those interested in craft production.</p><p>Barbara J.

Breaking out of his apolitical torpor, Pereira reluctantly rises to heroism.</p><p>Antonio Tabucchi has accomplished a rare feat: a socio-political novel with a decided left-wing slant that succeeds as a thriller. It is told through the voice of an aging editor at a Portuguese newspaper in 1938 during fascist rule. A murder inspires the editor out of acquiescence, and an underground movement ensues. The book rose to immediate success in Italy in 1994, a time when Italian fascism resurfaced, and Tabucchi&#39;s timely antidote to that movement was no doubt a factor in the novel&#39;s popularity. But widespread appeal of the book had as much to do with the page-turning nature of the work as its politics--a testament to Tabucchi&#39;s ability on both fronts.<p><strong>Antonio Tabucchi&nbsp;</strong>was born in Pisa in 1943 and died in Lisbon, his adopted home, in 2012.

How did they get the nickname "pepsis"? Why does Celine Dion put on a down-home accent when she returns to her home province? <br><br>For referendum-weary English Canadians, Quebec is an enigma wrapped in a yawn. Taras Grescoe treats the province as an exotic destination. He takes readers onto the shuffleboard courts of Florida, to a francophone country-and-western festival in rural Mauricie, to the caf� tables of expatriate Quebecers in Paris. He deconstructs a Montreal Canadiens hockey game, explores the stunning diversity of Quebec&#x2019;s newspapers, and dismantles Bombardier snowmobiles. En route, he meets Mohawk Warriors, Yiddish-speaking French Canadians, and the UFO-obsessed followers of Ra�l. <br><br>Informed and incisive, <i>Sacr� Blues</i> explores the heart of contemporary Quebec: its love-hate relationship with France and the United States; the dance, theatre, and literary productions celebrated in Europe but little known here; its fears about distinctness on an increasingly uniform continent. Along the way we meet such Quebec residents as the playwright Michel Tremblay and the novelist Neil Bissoondath, Teleglobe CEO Charles Sirois and the arctic explorer Bernard Voyer, the foul-mouthed columnist Pierre Foglia and the esteemed philosopher Charles Taylor. <br><br><i>Sacr� Blues</i> serves up a spicy, irreverent, inside view of this unique and little-known part of North America. With side orders of poutine, maple syrup, and Vachon snack cakes. And scarcely a mention of Lucien Bouchard.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>Taras Grescoe</b> has made a specialty of writing about foreign cultures for such publications as the <i>Times of London</i>, <i>National Geographic Traveller</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and the <i>Chicago Tribune Magazine</i>.

I love men; I love the way they smell. I love the way they taste, their texture, the way they're built. I'm a big fan of sex.'' This little prose pheromone from Henner's introduction, not to mention the bedroom- eyes double entendre of the title, says it all. If we're Arsenio, we pump our arms and say, ``Woo, woo.'' If we're Leno, we mug in mock horror at such brazenness on network TV. If we're Letterman, we grin and move on to stupid pet tricks. Aided by Jerome (coauthor of Roger Corman's How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime, not reviewed), Henner, who starred as Elaine Nardo in ``Taxi'' and currently appears in ``Evening Shade,'' presents herself as a Horatio Alger with legs (raising interesting questions, which Henner would no doubt gladly answer, about pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps). The beautiful thing about this book is the harmonic convergence between form and content that will occur when it comes time for Henner to plug it on Leno. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Henner, who played Elaine Nardo in the Emmy-winning TV show Taxi and costarred with Burt Reynolds in Evening Shade, here "tells it all" with coauthor Jerome. Raised in Chicago by parents who encouraged their children's self-expression, Henner launched her career in the national touring company of Grease. Moving from stage to film to TV, she led just as eclectic a private life. Uninhibited, she tells of her many relationships, including her short-lived marriage to actor Frederic Forrest. Devastated by her parents' premature deaths and a period where she couldn't find work, Henner entered therapy and went "macrobiotic," eating no dairy foods and exercising vigorously. Today, in her 40s, she is a happily married mother and looks "the best I ever looked." An upbeat story of a dynamic woman who keeps on moving no matter what.

He lives in Chard, Somerset.In a sequel to Goatsong, the continuing history of Golden Age Athens from the point of view of a comic playwright who survives the Great Peloponnesian War--a free-floating romp that makes a hash out of classical Greece. Holt, who's made a career with this sort of thing (Expecting Someone Taller is a comic variation on Wagner's Ring Cycle; Who's Afraid of Beowulf? deals with Norse sagas) scores again. Eupolis, in his early 20s, is married to Phaedra, beautiful and faithless, and is in rivalry (for his woman as well as for the comic crown) with Aristophanes. Here, Athens is about to go to war with Sicily, but the preparations for the voyage are ominous--among other things, vandals destroy street statues--and the campaign is a comedy of errors. The Athenians are slaughtered, but Eupolis muddles through. Along the way, he converses with ghosts and also with the god Dionysus, who tells him to protect Aristophanes. Eupolis and Aristophanes then stumble through enemy territory in a slapstick variation of a Laurel and Hardy routine--reciting fabricated Euripides and doing stand-up comedy. When they finally hitch a ride home on a cargo ship, Eupolis is tried for treason- -accused of having had a hand in the prewar vandalism. Under sentence of death, he defends himself eloquently after a talk with Socrates, among others. His acid speech in his own defense attacks the fickle masses and the new oligarchy, and he's found guilty by one vote. He proceeds to write a play that wins the Festival and makes him a hero, though Phaedra, with whom he's had an armed truce, takes sick and dies. The prose is sprightly, the satire loose-jointed and entertaining (but at times also pointed), and the history skewed enough to give the whole thing a juicy, authentic feel. Holt has obviously found his niche. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This process involves not only prayerful meditation, but as Dr. Chambers would insist, strenuous thought and spiritual concentration. Here is a worthy sequel to the devotional classic, My Utmost for His Highest. These selections from the writings of Oswald Chambers are warmly practical and deeply spiritual. They offer more than pious phrases and sweet thoughts, but actually constitute a commentary on real-life issues. A few samples . . . Faith cannot be intellectually defined; faith is the inborn captivity to see God behind everything, the wonder that keeps you an eternal child. We must learn to draw on the supernatural power of God, realizing that our enemies are supernatural, not natural; that our battling is not with difficult circumstances, it is altogether a battling that God is waging for us if we will draw on the supernatural forces. A Christian life lived on any other plane is an impossible life . . . no Christian has a right to be weak in God&#39;s strength. The Christian knows by bitter yet blessed conviction of sin that no man is sufficient for himself, and he thereby enters into identification with the cross of Calvary, and he longs and prays and works to see the sinful, self-centered world broken up and made the occasion for the mighty cross to have its way whereby men may come to God and God comes to men. Our Lord rebuked the disciples for fearing when apparently they had good reason for being alarmed. The problem is -- if Jesus Christ is only the carpenter of Nazareth, then the disciples were foolish to put Him at the tiller, but if He is the Son of God, what are they alarmed about? If Jesus Christ is God, where is my trust in Him? If He is not God, why am I so foolish as to pretend to worship</p><p>Oswald Chambers (1874-1917) was a Bible teacher, conference leader, and YMCA chaplain. After his death, his widow compiled his writings in a number of popular daily devotional books, including My Utmost for His Highest, an enduring classic of the Christian faith that continues to inspire men and women the world over.January 1 Can You See the Highest? He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters (Psalm 18:16). And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 2:6). The Lord Jesus Christ is the Highest. Is there anyone else higher to you than He is? Your life is never safeguarded until Jesus is seen to be the Highest. Past experience will not keep you, neither will deliverance from sin; the only safeguarding power is The Highest. If there is a breath of confidence anywhere else, there will be disaster, and it is by the mercy of God that you are allowed to stumble, or to be pain-smitten, until you learn that He does it all&#x2014;He keeps you from stumbling, He raises you up and keeps you up, He sends from above and delivers you. "Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling...." Whenever there is a complication in your circumstances, do nothing until you see the Highest&#x2014;not sometimes, but always (Isaiah 50:10). Can you see the Lord in your thinking? If not, suspend your judgment until you can. Can you see the face of Jesus in your affections? If not, restrain them until you can. Can you see God in your circumstances? If not, do nothing until you can. Our Lord can trust anything to the man or woman who sees Him. January 2 Are You Succoured by the Highest? The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn (Isaiah 61: 1&#x2013;2). If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose (Philippians 2:1&#x2013;2). Until a worker knows the succour of God, he is in danger of becoming a stumbling block to other souls. If we are not being succoured by the Highest, of what use can we be to those folks who are crushed by sorrows of which we know nothing? "The sacrifices of God are a broken heart" broken beyond any patching up, but&#x2014;"He hath sent Me to bind up the broken-hearted." The heart which has been bound up and succoured by the Lord Jesus Christ will never be got on the train of self-interest, there is no selfishness left in it. "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you." That is the most powerful thing God can do for us. The great note of the life which is comforted of God is&#x2014;"For my Lord I live; by my Lord I am strengthened, and in my Lord I am succoured." January 3 The Greatest Good Is the Highest End "If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it" (Matthew 7:11&#x2013;14). T he Shorter Catechism states, in answer to the question, "What is man's chief end?" that "Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him for ever." It is not what man puts into his body or on his body, but what he brings out of his body (Matthew 15:17&#x2013;20), and what he brings out of what he puts on his body, viz., his money, that reveals what he considers his chief end. A great many people imagine they have glorified God when they have given two halfpennies for a penny, or have saved a halfpenny. The highest good to them is to keep economic relations right, the highest Good from Jesus Christ's standpoint never dawns on them. The craze to-day is that the highest good is what a man has to live on: feed him, keep his body healthy, and his moral and religious life will be all right. That is the highest good according to the standard of many. As Christians it is more important to know how to live than what to live on.</p><h2>Daphne du Maurier&#39;s Classics of the Macabre</h2><p>This illustrated collection includes six du Maurier tales--&#34;Don&#39;t Look Now,&#34; &#34;The Birds,&#34; &#34;The Apple Tree,&#34; &#34;The Alibi,&#34; &#34;Not After Midnight,&#34; and &#34;The Blue Lenses&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>Bizarro and Other Strange Manifestations of the Art of Dan Piraro</h2><p>What goes on in the head of Dan Piraro-stand-up comedian, fine artist, animal rights activist, and creator of the award-winning syndicated comic strip Bizarro?

It is an epic story of extraordinary resilience as the Libyan port's 24,000 defenders met increasingly desperate attempts by Rommel's Panzer divisions to break through the hurriedly thrown-up defences. It was a battle of bayonets and grenades against tanks, of David versus Goliath.</p><p>The eventual allied victory came against overwhelming odds, plus the morale sapping knowledge that the defenders were surrounded on one side by the sea, and on the other by Hitler's men and machines (who, only the year before, had brought Western Europe to its knees). Tobruk was defended in the main by the Australian 9th Division, followed by the British 70th Infantry Division who then linked up with the advancing 8th Army. The Royal Navy also played an important role in Tobruk's defence. By December 1941 Rommel had been beaten and forced to withdraw his forces from Cyrenaica. The siege was lifted and the exhausted, gallant defenders able to march out in triumph.</p></p><p><p>Robert Lyman was for twenty years an officer in the British Army.

By the author of An Atlas of the Difficult World.</p><p>Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes two National Book Awards, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant, and a Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.Award-winning poet Rich offers a new volume of collected essays (Blood, Bread, and Poetry, 1986, etc.) that feature her distinct blend of feminist polemics and sharp-sighted analysis of the American condition, spiced with verses from a range of kindred spirits. Poetry is as necessary as food, shelter, education, and other human basics, Rich asserts, exploring the relationship between a poet's social responsibility and the world of experience that provides poetry's raw material. The notion of artist-activists remains primary even as Rich acknowledges that poetry, with limited ``value'' in a market economy as entrenched as ours, has been effectively marginalized. The struggle for political power through poetic expression is an engagement on many fronts, as minority voices speak out along with oppressed women, the poor along with the gay community. Quoting Muriel Rukeyser, June Jordan, and others to emphasize that poetry can convey valuable messages of social redemption, Rich also draws on sources from Trotsky to Wallace Stevens to illustrate her own educational path. Her understanding that racism and sexism are integral parts of the social landscape wasn't attained overnight, and the painful process of emergence from an early life of privileged narrowness into a fuller awareness is recounted at length. The transformative, conjuring power of poetry is reaffirmed throughout, with its potential impact enhanced as it finds its rightful place in the cultural mainstream. Challenging and rewarding as always, although at times the essays serve as little more than venues for the poetry and words of others. In giving access to lesser-known but like-minded writers, Rich has reduced her own presence--a disappointing trade-off. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He lives in Northern Ireland, just outside Belfast, and loves to travel."Flavoured with a voice that blends the delightful prose of Jack Vance with the idiosyncratic stylings of Cordwainer Smith, this novel is, most of all, about the dusty town of <i>Desolation Road</i> in the middle of the red Martian desert. Episodic in scope, it would also work as short stories.

Dorothy became a frequent houseguest of Twain&#x2019;s, both at his Tuxedo Park home, in New York City, and in Redding Connecticut. Her recollections of life in those places dispel the image of Twain as a man bitter and pessimistic in his later years, revealing him instead as warm and fun-loving.

Historian, investigator and storyteller David J. Pitkin spent 9 years interviewing across New England to present these tales of returned relatives, store ghosts, campus ghosts, spirits in old hotels and inns, and modern restaurants--and, of course, haunted residences. Aiming not to scare you, but to draw you into profound thinking about the life that continues after your body dies, he continues in his role of teacher. We must all pass through the state of being a ghost, he tells us. See whether or not you think he makes his case. Accompanied by 75 photos, his eighth book demonstrates how common are the appearances and antics of the departed, who have been experienced by the living for thousands of years. He often discovers who these unique personalities are and why they remain among us when something better still awaits them. Not that many of them are to be feared, as they are just continuing what they struggled with in life.</p><p>From his first ghostly experience of hearing footsteps on a no-longer-existing barn hayloft floor to the present, David J. Pitkin has been intrigued with the deeper dimensions of death and its aftermath. Research led him to the story of an unhappy young man who had taken that walk almost 40 years before, only to throw himself off the ledge with a noose around his neck. Since that first surprise, Pitkin has interviewed over 1,400 people and has printed over 750 of those stories in eight books. He has traveled North America and the Caribbean gathering even more as-yet-unwritten tales. For Pitkin, a retired history teacher, research is the key to identifying the entities and their still-unfulfilled purposes that seem to remain after bodily death. Unlike many purveyors of fear, Pitkin finds it even more tantalizing to scientifically explain the ghost phenomenon as a natural progression from bodily striving to eternal existence. All people will be ghosts after life ends, he says. A popular interviewee on radio and television, Pitkin is also a storyteller. He says his mission is to enlighten people, not frighten them. And most often, ghosts are the remnants of deceased loved ones and not terrible demons. Still, he cautions impetuous young investigators about dabbling in ghost matters without knowledge and protection.Readers will not be disappointed with New England Ghosts by David J. Pitkin. Pitkin can not only tell a spellbinding story, he is truly well-versed in the varied theories of the paranormal and metaphysics. Pitkin is a researcher who makes you think, as well as shiver, as he recounts some great tales of New England ghosts and hauntings. --Brad Steiger, author of Real Ghosts, Restless Spirits, and Haunted Places</p><h2>In the Realms of Gold: Pioneering in African History</h2><p>Over the last fifty years, Roland Oliver has been both a witness to the post-colonial history of Africa and a preeminent scholar of the continent&#x2019;s pre-colonial history. Oliver was a young Cambridge graduate in 1947 when he took a newly created position at the University of London to research, and eventually teach, the pre-colonial history of Africa. Seeking from the outset to establish a unified conception of African history free from European frameworks, Oliver and his colleague John Fage went on to write the influential <i>A Short History of Africa</i>, found the <i>Journal of African History</i>, and co-edit the eight-volume <i>Cambridge History of Africa</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In the Realms of Gold</i> is Oliver&#x2019;s account of his life and work. He writes in a deft and lively style about the circumstances of his early life that shaped his education and outlook: his childhood on a river houseboat in Kashmir, the influential teachers and friends met at Stowe and Cambridge, and his service in World War II as a cryptographer in British intelligence, where he met his first wife, Caroline Linehan. His interest in church history while at Cambridge led him to study the historical effects of Christian missionaries in Africa, and thus his career began.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The core of the book is Oliver&#x2019;s account of his research travels throughout tropical Africa from the 1940s to the 1980s; his efforts to train and foster African graduate students to teach in African universities; his role in establishing conferences and journals to bring together the work of historians and archaeologists from Europe and Africa; his encounters with political and religious leaders, scholars, soldiers, and storytellers; and the political and economic upheavals of the continent that he witnessed.</p><p>Born in India of British colonial parents, Roland Oliver moved to Africa as a young man and became one of the continent's leading modern historians. In this memoir, he writes of his work in training African scholars to conduct regional surveys and collect oral histories, in assembling the multivolume <i>Cambridge History of Africa</i>, and in struggling to give African history academic legitimacy at a time when most universities did not have scholars qualified to teach even an elementary course in the subject. Along the way Oliver considers the questions that engage Africanists today, such as the significance of European colonialism in the historical development of the continent and whether nationalism did more harm than good in the formation of modern African states.Roland Oliver is emeritus professor of the history of Africa at the University of London. His most famous book, <i>A Short History of Africa</i>, has been translated into some dozen languages, and among his many other books are <i>The African Experience</i>, <i>Africa since 1800</i>, and <i>The Cambridge History of Africa</i>.</p><h2>Vegan Baking (Vegan Cookbook Series)</h2><p><br>This collection presents more than 100 brand-new recipes for cakes, loaves, biscuits, no-bake cakes, and savory baking&#x2014;all free of animal products.

Instantly recognizable as the seemingly serene, cool and derached wife of Winston Churchill she had nonetheless shunned publicity throughout her life. In this biography her daughter, Mary Soames, throws light on her mother, writing of Clementine&#39;s 57-year marriage to Winston, her strongly held political views and a life which spans many of the major events of the 20th century. Clementine Churchill was the perfect wife for Winston. For 75 years she supported him through the triumphs, disasters and tensions which ruled his public and private life. As a young girl she had a strength of character and distinction of mind, allied to outstanding good looks, that attracted the young and impetuous Winston Churchill. The early years of her marriage coincided with the heyday of the reforming Liberal Government, in which Winston was a leading figure: she was later to describe them as the happiest of her life. Always Winston trusted her completely and she became a valuable counsellor and companion. Clementine was shy, passionate and highly strung, and her self-control was tested to its utmost in the turmoil of public life and in the no less harrowing family crises and the ever-present financial anxieties. But one facet of her life was steadfast: the love she shared with her husband, which was to sustain them both even through the most trying times.</p><p>Mary Soames is the youngest and only surviving child of Winston and Clementine Churchill. She was born in 1922 and brought up at Chartwell in Kent. In 1941, aged eighteen, she joined the ATS and served in mixed anti-aircraft batteries in England and north-west Europe. She accompanied her father as his ADC on several of his wartime overseas journeys. In 1945 she was awarded the MBE (military). In 1947 she married Captain Christopher Soames, Coldstream Guards, later Lord Soames, PC, GCMG, CH. She has also written A Churchill Family Album, The Profligate Duke, Winston Churchill, His Life as a Painter and edited Speaking For Themselves the personal letters between Winston and Clementine Churchill.</p><h2>Record of a Spaceborn Few: Wayfarers 3</h2><p>&#39;The best speculative fiction currently being written&#39; John Connolly From the ground, we stand.

The incredible new novel by Becky Chambers, author of the beloved The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. #SpacebornFew Centuries after the last humans left Earth, the Exodus Fleet is a living relic, a place many are from but few outsiders have seen. Humanity has finally been accepted into the galactic community, but while this has opened doors for many, those who have not yet left for alien cities fear that their carefully cultivated way of life is under threat. Tessa chose to stay home when her brother Ashby left for the stars, but has to question that decision when her position in the Fleet is threatened.

His 1,250-acre Gardens of El Pedregal, begun in 1945 on the lava fields of south of Mexico City, were dotted with houses and plazas, fountains and ponds, cacti and pepper trees. Barragan considered El Pedregal his most important project, and critics have described the houses and gardens there as a turning point in Mexican architecture. This book examines El Pedregal&#39;s program and form, its representation in architect-commissioned photographs and advertising, and its place within contemporary discourses on cultural identity, design and place, and suburbanization. Like our highly acclaimed Revolution of Form, Luis Barragan&#39;s Gardens of El Pedregal offers an in-depth analysis of this now mostly destroyed project through original documents, drawings, color and black-and-white photography, and critical examinations of the design process.</p><p></p><h2>Classic Woodworking Projects (Handyman Club library)</h2><p>This edition of Home Woodworking: Classic Projects for Y</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine</h2><p>Chinese Medicine has never been so popular and relevant to the modern way of life.

This new study reveals the breadth and range of what has been described as the slumbering giant in the world of spirituality&#39;.

As <i>Open Ice</i> explains, the sport's attraction is that anyone can play it, whether young, old, average Joe, or superstar athlete. This lively book explores the genesis and growth of curling from humble origins in stream-beds centuries ago to its present status as an Olympic sport and cult favorite. In surveying curling's wide history, author Doug Clark&nbsp;includes a fascinating&nbsp;range of the many and&nbsp;often unusual places such as James Bond and Beatles movies it appears. Clark takes readers behind the scenes at the Olympics, explores the giddy highs and tragic lows of momentous moments in curling history, and introduces an unforgettable array of eccentric curlers, including The King of Swing,&#x201d; noted for his dancing prowess and swing&#x201d; ice that makes rocks curl wildly.</p><p><p>Doug Clark is a freelance journalist whose work has appeared in publications such as the <i>Globe and Mail, Saturday Night, Macleanís,</i> and the <i>Toronto Star</i>.

Curling thrives as the only sport where men and women can compete equally in the same forum and by the same rules, where rank amateurs can play competitively against the sportís elites, where anyone from nine to ninety can get involved. Curling blends sport, tradition, lifestyle, health, and camaraderie around the single most important rule of the game, marked by the three Cs: Curling Cheats Confess. In that regard, curling isn't just a way of life �&#x20ac;&#x201d; it's a pretty good foundation for living life.</p> <p>Touching on the history, highlights, humour, and even horrors of curling, Doug Clark focuses on the Canadian innovations that helped popularize the sport worldwide and hoist it onto the silver screen and Olympic gold.</p></p><h2>The Oldest Rookie: Big-League Dreams from a Small-Town Guy</h2><p>Presents the inspirational true story of Jim Morris&#39;s departure from the minor leagues after a string of injuries, his career as a high school physics teacher, and his eventual return to the minors followed by an all-star career in the majors. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Jim Morris was a high school physics teacher until becoming a professional ballplayer at age 35. He is currently a relief pitcher for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and lives in San Angelo, Texas.Sports autobiographies are usually boring or clich�d; THE OLDEST ROOKIE is neither. The story of Jim Morris, a retired minor leaguer who becomes a Major League pitcher at age 35, defies the odds. Not only is it true, it's the stuff of dreams. Kevin O'Rourke makes this inspiring tale even better. Morris is a likable athlete, not primarily concerned about money and prestige, and O'Rourke demonstrates those traits. He conveys Morris's emotions, capturing everything from Morris's youthful dreams to his many frustrations and trepidations. In addition, O'Rourke's use of inflection and his subtle changes in pace add to the presentation. This book is not just for baseball fans; it's for anyone whose childhood fantasies will not die.

Born in Stockholm to a staunchly Lutheran family, he graduated from the University of Uppsala and then traveled to England, Holland, France, and Germany to study the leading scientists of the time. He gained favor with Sweden&#x2019;s King Charles XII, who gave him the position of overseer of the Swedish mining industry. Later, he was given a seat on the Swedish House of Nobles by Charles XII&#x2019;s successor, Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Between 1743 and 1745 he began to have visions of heaven, hell, and Jesus Christ which resulted in a stream of books about the nature of God, the afterlife, and the inner meaning of the Bible. He devoted the last decades of his life to studying Scripture and presenting his own unique theology to the world.</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Some people believe it is hard to lead the heaven-bound life that is called &#x2018;spiritual&#x2019; because they have heard that we need to renounce the world and give up the desires attributed to the body and the flesh and &#x2018;live spiritually.&#x2019; All they understand by this is spurning worldly interests, especially concerns for money and prestige, going around in constant devout meditation about God, salvation, and eternal life, devoting their lives to prayer, and reading the Word and religious literature. They think this is renouncing the world and living for the spirit and not for the flesh. However, the actual case is quite different, as I have learned from an abundant experience and conversation with angels. In fact, people who renounce the world and live for the spirit in this fashion take on a mournful life for themselves, a life that is not open to heavenly joy, since our life does remain with us [after death]. No, if we would accept heaven&#x2019;s life, we need by all means to live in the world and to participate in its duties and affairs. In this way, we accept a spiritual life by means of our moral and civic life; and there is no other way a spiritual life can be formed within us, no other way our spirits can be prepared for heaven. This is because living an inner life and not an outer life at the same time is like living in a house that has no foundation, that gradually either settles or develops gaping cracks or totters until it collapses.&#x201d;</p><p></p></p><h2>Afro-American Folktales (Pantheon Fairy Tale &amp; Folklore Library)</h2><p>This addition to the Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library completes Roger Abrahams&#39;s masterful survey of taletelling in the black world by showing the vital forms African stories took as they entered the New World. These 107 tales come from the canefields of the antebellum South, the villages of Caribbean islands, and the streets of contemporary Philadelphia. Throbbing with life, they range from earthy comedy (in recounting the scandalous doings of tricksters Rabbit and Fox) to inventive &#34;just-so&#34; stories explaining why the world is the way it is, to moral fables about encounters between masters and slaves, kings and servants, black and white. Together, they robustly demonstrate the ways an uprooted people have drawn from the traditions of their past to fashion a life -- and with it, a whole new and vital culture -- in the New World.</p><p>Praise for African Folktales, the companion volume to Afro-American Folktales:<br><br>"Another masterful addition and accessible introduction to the captured myths of what the Mede call 'God's Chiefdom'....Sweeping across the continent as swiftly as a pair of enchanted Togo sandals, the juxtaposition of tribes and pacing of story lengths make for lively reading:"<br><br>Washington Post Book World<br><br>"Earthy and comedic...a rousing good read....I suspect Mr. Abrahams' book will be read a generation hence."<br><br>New York Times Book Review</p><h2>Tempted (A House of Night Novel)</h2><p>Zoey Redbird, High Priestess-in-training, finds herself juggling three guys--one of which is so into protecting her that he can sense her emotions.

Its brilliance made the ice that coated the city, and the Benedictine Abbey where we'd just had our showdown with a fallen immortal and a rogue High Priestess, shimmer so that everything around me seemed touched by our Goddess. I looked at the moonlight-bathed circle that stood in front of Mary's Grotto, the place of power where not long ago Spirit, Blood, Earth, Humanity, and Night had been personified and then had joined to triumph over hatred and darkness. The carved image of Mary, surrounded by stone roses and nestled within a ledge high in the grotto, appeared to be a beacon for the silver light. I stared at the statue. Mary's expression was serene; her ice-covered cheeks glistened as if she wept in quiet joy.</p><p>My gaze lifted to the sky. <i>Thank you.</i> I sent a silent prayer up to the beautiful crescent that symbolized my Goddess, Nyx. <i>We're alive. Kalona and Neferet are gone.</i></p><p>"Thank you," I whispered to the moon.</p><p><i>Listen within .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>The words swept through me, subtle and sweet like leaves touched by a summer breeze, brushing my consciousness so lightly that my waking mind barely registered them, yet Nyx's whispered command imprinted itself into my soul.</p><p>I was vaguely aware that there were a lot of people (well, nuns, fledglings, and a few vampyres) around me. I could hear the mixture of shouting, talking, crying, and even laughing that filled the night, but it all felt distant. At that moment the only things that were real to me were the moon above and the scar that sliced from one shoulder all the way across my chest to the other shoulder. It tingled in response to my silent prayer, but it wasn't a tingle of pain. Not really. It was a familiar warm, prickling sensation that assured me Nyx had, once again, Marked me as hers. I knew if I peeked under the neck of my shirt I would find a new tattoo decorating that long, angry-looking scar with an exotic filigree of sapphire--a sign that proved I was following my Goddess's path.</p><p>"Erik and Heath, find Stevie Rae, Johnny B, and Dallas--then check the perimeter of the abbey to be certain all the Raven Mockers fled with Kalona and Neferet!" Darius shouted the command, snapping me out of my warm, fuzzy prayer mode, and once I'd been shocked out, it was like an iPod had been cranked too high as sound and confusion flooded my senses.</p><p>"But Heath's a human. A Raven Mocker could kill him in a second." The words burst from my mouth before I could clamp it shut, proving beyond all doubt that being moonstruck wasn't my only moronic skill.</p><p>Predictably, Heath puffed up like a cat-smacked toad.</p><p>"Zo, I'm not a damn pussy!"</p><p>Erik, looking very tall and full-grown, kick-your-butt vampyre-like, snorted sarcastically and then said, "No, you're a damn human. Wait, that <i>does</i> make you a pussy!"</p><p>"So, we defeat the big baddies and inside five minutes Erik and Heath are banging their chests at each other. How totally predictable," Aphrodite said with her patented sarcastic sneer as she joined Darius, but her expression completely changed when she turned her attention to the Son of Erebus Warrior. "Hey there, Hotness. You doing okay?"</p><p>"You need not worry about me," Darius said. His eyes met hers, and they practically telegraphed the chemistry between them, but instead of going to her like he usually would and doing some very gross kissing, he remained focused on Stark.</p><p>Aphrodite's gaze went from Darius to Stark. "Okay, eew. Your chest is totally crispy crittered."</p><p>James Stark was standing between Darius and Erik. Okay, well, <i>standing</i> wasn't exactly what he was doing. Stark was swaying and looking extremely unsteady.</p><p>Ignoring Aphrodite, Erik spoke up. "Darius, you should probably get Stark inside. I'll coordinate the reconnoitering with Stevie Rae and make sure everything runs smoothly out here." His words seemed okay, but his tone was all I'm-the-big-guy-in-charge, and when he followed up with a condescending "I'll even let Heath help out," he really sounded like a pompous butt.</p><p>"You'll <i>let me</i> help out?" Heath snapped. "Your <i>mom</i> will let me help out."</p><p>"Hey, which one of them is supposed to be your boyfriend?" Stark asked me. Even in the terrible shape he was in, he caught my glance with his. His voice was scratchy, and he sounded scarily weak, but his eyes sparkled with humor.</p><p>"I am!" Heath and Erik said together.</p><p>"Oh, for crap's sake, Zoey, they're both idiots!" Aphrodite said.</p><p>Stark started to chuckle, which turned to a cough, which changed again to a painful gasp. His eyes rolled back and, like a slinky, he collapsed.</p><p>Moving with the quickness that came naturally to a Son of Erebus Warrior, Darius caught Stark before he hit the ground. "I need to get him inside," Darius said.</p><p>I felt like my head was going to explode. Sagging in Darius's arms, Stark looked well on his way to being dead. "I-I don't even know where the infirmary is," I stuttered.</p><p>"Not a problem. I'll get a penguin to show us," Aphrodite said. "Hey, you, nun!" she yelled at one of the nearby black-and-white-clad sisters who had scurried out of the abbey after the night had gone from battle chaos to aftermath chaos.</p><p>Darius hurried after the nun, with Aphrodite following him. The warrior glanced over his shoulder at me. "Aren't you coming with us, Zoey?"</p><p>"As soon as I can." Before I could deal with Erik and Heath, from behind me a familiar twang saved the day.</p><p>"Go on with Darius and Aphrodite, Z. I'll take care of Dumb and Dumber and be sure there's no booger monsters left out here."</p><p>"Stevie Rae, you are the Best Friend of All Best Friends." I turned and hugged her quickly, loving how reassuringly solid and normal she felt. Actually, she seemed so normal that I got a weird twinge when she stepped back and grinned at me and I saw, as if for the first time, the scarlet tattoos that spread out from the filled-in crescent in the middle of her forehead and down either side of her face. A sliver of unease threaded through me.</p><p>Misunderstanding my hesitation, she said, "Don't worry about these two dorks. I'm gettin' used to jerking them apart." When I just stood there staring at her, the bright smile she'd been wearing dimmed. "Hey, you know your grandma's okay, right? Kramisha got her back inside right after Kalona was banished and Sister Mary Angela just told me she was goin' inside to check on her."</p><p>"Yeah, I remember Kramisha helping her into the wheelchair. I'm just .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." My voice trailed off. I was just what? How could I put into words that I was haunted by a feeling that everything wasn't right with my best friend and the group of kids she'd allied herself with, and how do I say that <i>to</i> my best friend?</p><p>"You're just tired and worried 'bout a bunch of stuff," Stevie Rae said softly.</p><p><i>Was that understanding I saw flicker through her eyes? Or was it something else, something darker?</i></p><p>"I get it, Z, and I'll take care of things out here. You just be sure Stark's okay." She hugged me again, and then gave me a little push in the direction of the abbey.</p><p>"'Kay. Thanks," I said lamely, starting toward the abbey and totally ignoring the two dorks who were standing there staring at me.</p><p>Stevie Rae called after me, "Hey, remind Darius or someone to keep an eye on the time. It's only about an hour until sunrise, and you know me and all the red fledglings gotta be inside out of the sun by then."</p><p>"Yeah, no problem. I'll remember," I said.</p><p>The problem was it was getting harder and harder for me to <i>forget</i> Stevie Rae wasn't what she used to be.</p><p>TEMPTED Copyright � 2009 by P. C.

In <i>Raising Your Spirited Child,</i> Mary Sheedy Kurcinka's first contribution is to redefine the "difficult child" as the "spirited" child, a child that is, as she says, MORE. Many people are leery about books that are too quick to "type" kids, but Kurcinka, a parent of a spirited child herself and a parent educator for 20 years, doesn't fall into that trap. Instead, she provides tools to understanding your own temperament as well as your child's. When you understand your temperamental matches--and your mismatches--you can better understand, work, live, socialize, and enjoy spirit in your child. By reframing challenging temperamental qualities in a positive way, and by giving readers specific tools to work with these qualities, Kurcinka has provided a book that will help all parents, especially the parents of spirited children, understand and better parent their children.<p>Mary Sheedy Kurcinka, M.A., is an award-winning educator in Minnesota's Early Childhood Family Education Program, and founder of the Spirited Child and Power Struggles workshops.

Livshin's voice, too, is ecstatic--and unflinching, and loving, and full of earned wisdom. In poem after poem, Livshin, who&nbsp;immigrated to the US from Russia as a child, acknowledges the two Americas she knows firsthand: the one that fears and demonizes, and the one that welcomes. <i>A Life Replaced</i>&nbsp;is astonishingly beautiful, intelligent, and important.&nbsp;--Maggie SmithThis is a book that lays all its cards on the table. We see poetic influences, yes. We see conversations, yes. But we also see the music of play, both textual and mundane, play that allows others to enter and tango and transform. This a strange book--hauntingly beautiful and unforgettable.&nbsp;--Ilya Kaminsky&nbsp;Original poetry by the Russian-American poet Olga Livshin, alongside her translations of Russian poetry by Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966) and Vladimir Gandelsman (b. 1948). Foreword by Ilya Kaminsky. <i>A Life Replaced</i> is the fourth book from Poets &amp; Traitors Press.</p><p>I came to the United States with my parents during what seemed to be the aftermath of the only cold war, and what turned out to be only an interlude. It is clear, in 2019, that we are living during a new, more inventive cold war--and in a quiet, episodic civil war.&nbsp;This book is an attempt to see the US as a complex country, a place of compassion and tribalism and social justice and intense hatred. And hope, for specific people with their specific actions.&nbsp;Millions of perfect strangers--perfectly wonderful strangers--welcome us, and each other. And yet there is, was, and may always be another America, the one with its own historical wounds as well as xenophobic aspirations--and, lately, outcries and crimes. These days, when even naturalized citizens of the United States are being denaturalized, my American life can be revoked at any time. The America this book attempts to describe is not hateful; neither do I picture it as Janus-faced. It includes immigrants and our own oversized emotional baggage. And the gyrations of nativist fear. And the possibility of this country as a refuge, only enabled by individuals, never by governments as a whole."What a blazing book! Fiery and original, its originality rooted partly in its passionate indebtedness. Olga Livshin has created her own genetic strands from the poems of Anna Akhmatova, Vladimir Gandelsman, and the Russian and English languages. Her passionate lyrics blend wit, sorrow, fury, mother love, and eros in lines at once tender, savage, and scarred by history."&nbsp;--Rosanna Warren&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this sensuous, funny, dark, and tender collection, Livshin documents her life as a Russian-American, American-Russian, an immigrant, a Jew, grappling with memory, home, exile, and survival amidst violent times, braided with the worlds of the interlocutors she translates. In reply to Anna Ahkmatova, and to all of us, Livshin implores: 'This century is worse than those before it. Change something.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nomi Stone&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"A Life Replaced&nbsp;</i>is a true literary hybrid, a book-conversation in which Livshin's original poetry and her translations call to one another, blurring the borders between centuries, countries, and languages. Daring and tender, unapologetically political and deeply personal, it is a timely reminder of what it means to be an immigrant."&nbsp;--Ellen Litman</p><h2>Cloudstreet</h2><p>Tells the story of the Pickles and the Lambs, two families marked by tragedy as they weather the vagaries of life and chance, and of Fish Lamb, endowed with strange powers after his mind is damaged in a drowning accident</p><p><p>Tim Winton is widely considered one of the greatest living Australian writers. He has published twenty-four books, and his work has been translated into twenty-eight languages. Since his first novel, <i>An Open Swimmer</i>, won the Australian/Vogel Award in 1981, he has won the Miles Franklin Award four times (for <i>Shallows</i>, <i>Cloudstreet, Dirt Music,</i> and <i>Breath</i>) and twice been shortlisted for the Booker Prize (for <i>The Riders</i> and <i>Dirt Music</i>). He lives in Western Australia.</p>With sensitivity and vision, novelist Tim Winton creates an Australian classic that takes the listener into the world of two wholly believable working-class families in post-WWII Perth. The Pickles family inherits, but cannot afford to keep, Cloudstreet, a rambling, ramshackled house--so they take in the Lambs as their boarders. The Pickles are an irreligious, indolent lot, while the Lambs are pious and hard-working. Peter Hosking's performance is true to Winton's unsentimental exploration into humankind's ability to love and survive amid adversity. Hosking handles the mundane and the mystical with equal assurance. His characterizations, including an aboriginal ghost and a talking pig, are earthy, real, and frequently hilarious. Hosking makes the most of Winton's honesty, wit, and original imagery. S.J.H.

Ahead of plant selection, one of the most important lessons to learn when making a garden is to consider how each area is going to be used. Each defined space should have a purpose--what architects refer to as a program. Will you be eating outdoors? Will you be entertaining small groups of friends for dinner or having formal cocktail parties for work? Do you have kids and/or pets? Is there a quiet spot to escape from the kids with a drink or a book? How well do you like your neighbors? Can you create some sense of privacy? Ask yourself these important lifestyle questions to plan your valuable outdoor spaces most effectively and keep them from going unused, which is a waste of valuable time and money.<br><br>The Outdoor Room<br><br>Of course, the answers to many of the above questions will vary according to where you live. Speaking from personal experience as a native Texan, many residents of that state possess a seemingly innate desire to stay indoors. Perhaps it's the heat, but let's be frank--the weather in much of the state is temperate for a large portion of the year. To thwart that tendency at an Austin, Texas, garden, landscape designer Mark Word specifically added smart elements to entice people outdoors. The small walled courtyard of the newly built house is a stylized campground of sorts with simple painted wood furniture, a fire pit, and a small running "stream" (abstracted as a tiered steel fountain). This elemental approach employs earth, fire, air, and water to transform what could otherwise merely be a pass-through space or, at its worst, a claustrophobic cell that never gets used. Now instead, it's a spot for evening drinks by the fire. Flowers in the graveled space, even plants themselves, are few--but it's still a garden in the classic sense. Word combined a few special selections- -yellow abutilon with prehistoric-looking rice paper plant (Tetrapanax papyriferus), plume poppy (Macleaya cordata), and the twisted trunk of a slender shoestring acacia (Acacia stenophylla)--into a sculpture garden of bold plants. The splashing fountain, deep enough to sustain several hardy water lilies through the winter, drowns out street noise.<br><br>By using striking plant selections and simple materials, designer Mark Word turned the stark architecture of a courtyard in Austin, Texas, into a pocket garden of dramatic plants, a water feature, a seating area, and a fire pit.<br><br>Homeowner Dan Seaver, wanted a backyard that was more than just an ordinary patch of grass ringed with flowerbeds. He ended up with a multiuse space, above, featuring an elegant outdoor dining room, a vegetable garden, and a small bit of lawn for his daughter.<br><br>In a part of Venice, California, that is making the transition from modest midcentury bungalows to contemporary (but still small-scale) home remodels, Dan Seaver and his spouse, Will Speck, created a private backyard with an open-air dining room surrounded by gravel. Previously, the space was almost completely barren, so it was vitally important to inject some sense of spatial definition. Mark Tessier, their landscape architect, had the idea to add some truly green architecture--a shady grove of six African sumac trees (Rhus lancea). Their willowy leaves and slender reddish brown trunks form an airy canopy over an outdoor table where Seaver says it is cool and inviting on even the hottest day. The drought-tolerant, low-maintenance sumacs are evergreen but frequently shed their leaves, meaning they can be a bit messy. So you need to be either okay with a little regular sweeping or comfortable with a little naturalistic imperfection. There are just a few furnishings in this simple garden: a rustically modern wooden table, a stone sphere, and a shallow concrete birdbath. A small vegetable garden and a square of lawn for the couple's young daughter are the only parts of the property that require much in the way of regular water.<br><br>In Ojai, California, landscape designer Paul Hendershot makes gardens that gracefully borrow style and mood from parts of the world that share his hot dry climate--such as Provence, Italy, and Spain. In such locations, the sun is strong, shade is a necessity, and plants have to be tough and drought resistant. Outdoor dining and activities like bocce are essential parts of the lifestyle. For a home just outside the town of Ojai, Hendershot planted a dense canopy of fruitless mulberries (Morus alba 'Stribling') in a gravel terrace surrounded with clipped herbs and walls made of stone excavated on the site. The trees' dense leaves throw cool shadows over the dining area all summer. In the mild winter, the trees lose their leaves, allowing diners to bask in the sun, which is welcome by that time. Hendershot picked a fruitless variety to avoid the mess caused by the dark-staining berries and the visiting hungry birds that enjoy the fruit and spread the seeds far and wide.<br><br>Mind the Roots<br><br>Mulberries are fairly tolerant of drought once they get established, but be aware that their aggressive roots are large and shallow, so these trees shouldn't be placed near masonry or sidewalks. At a garden in Ojai, California, Paul Hendershot set up a watering system for the trees that irrigates them deeply once a week, keeping the roots from growing too near the surface. As is common in Europe, the trees are kept small and dense by pollarding them (pruning back their upper branches to the main set of limbs) once a year in late winter or early spring.<br><br>A surprisingly graphic approach can be seen in a garden created by designer Beth Mullins of Growsgreen Landscape Design for Tom Lakritz and Chris Wagner. The clients requested a unusual garden element for their small backyard in the Monterey Heights neighborhood of San Francisco: a labyrinth. In the past few years, these intricate garden features have become much sought after as meditative spaces. Often, the labyrinth is fairly large and situated as a destination out in a larger property to draw people away from the house and into another part of the garden. This 17- foot-wide design, inspired by the patterns found in San Francisco's Grace Cathedral and medieval churches like Chartres, takes up most of the backyard--that's quite a spatial commitment. Mullins outlined her walkable design with clumps of Berkeley sedge (Carex divulsa) in gravel instead of calling for a tighter pattern mown in lawn or using more conventional hedges of yew or boxwood. The sedge labyrinth doesn't need much water, and Mullins says it requires clipping or a little thinning only three times a year, when it gets to be about 2 feet tall. This unusual garden element makes a graphic design for viewing from the house or the raised deck while satisfying its original function as a meaningful contemplative activity for the homeowners as they walk its course.<br><br>Every outdoor room should have a well-considered purpose. Paul Hendershot created a family gathering place in sunny Ojai, California, under a cool canopy of fruitless mulberry trees.<br><br>At the request of her San Francisco clients, Beth Mullins designed a labyrinth of drought-tolerant grasses for their small backyard.<br><br>For clients in Brooklyn, Susan Welti and Paige Keck came up with a narrow sequence of garden rooms that makes a large but narrow backyard appear even larger. Nearest the house is an informal seating area. At the rear is a dining area and custom-designed playhouse.<br><br>A Multiuse Space<br><br>In Brooklyn, designers Susan Welti and Paige Keck of Foras Studio renovated an unhappy backyard dominated by a derelict lawn and a motley collection of overgrown shrubs. They replaced it with a stylishly modern family garden subdivided by stone pavers, a grove of trees, and a wooden boardwalk. That's a far cry from what Gigi Sharp and George Gilpin saw when they bought the place in 2003. At that time, the lawn was a muddy, mosquito- ridden mess. Even in its compromised condition, the narrow backyard was an enormous draw for the couple with two young sons: The end-to-end double lot, measuring 20 by 80 feet, stretches from street to street, with a garage in the rear.<br><br>Though the house is a classic 19th-century brownstone, Welti and the owners wanted to modernize the garden so that it would better suit the style of the new concrete, glass, and metal addition that the couple had built on the back of the house. The long, narrow garden already had a small patio and several changes in its levels, a feature that Welti found very appealing since a completely flat space doesn't hold as much design interest. In this case, the small series of grade changes fell in just the right proportions for the designer, so she kept them, knowing that this simple decision would save a lot of the expense and environmental damage of regrading the site and hauling away tons of soil and debris. She replaced the outmoded railroad ties that had formed the most prominent low wall near the house with poured concrete and replaced the soggy, poorly draining patch of lawn with a small grove of trees. Welti feels that all too often, homeowners with outdoor space have a strong, almost innate, desire to try to grow bright green lawns. But in a shady urban situation where the soil and drainage are often questionable, it takes an inordinate amount of effort (including the use of artificial fertilizer and chemicals) to get turf to be pristine. In most cases, she advises her clients to do without traditional grass. With the lawn removed, the replacement surfaces-- groundcover plants, pavers, wood boardwalk, and river stones--help move the once neglected garden into the new century.<br><br>Dividing a Space Makes It Seem Bigger<br><br>Garden designers have long known something that seems counterintuitive: Taking a small space and separating it into different, discrete areas makes it seem larger. A tall hedge, a wall, a fence, or an opaque clump of shrubs keeps a visitor from seeing the whole view at once, even if it is a relatively compact space, above. Each turned corner provides a new discovery: a private dining area or a secluded seating area with a bench and a fountain. Nothing is more boring than to look out the back door and see the whole yard spread out to be viewed at a glance. What's the point in going outside to take a look around when there is nothing to go around?<br><br>Planting Small<br><br>Though the plantings in the Sharp and Gilpin yard look fully mature now, this was hardly a garden with instantaneous results. Since most of the container-grown plants were purchased in small sizes ranging from 5 to 10 gallons, the garden required several years to reach its desired state--an approach that takes patience and trust on the part of the homeowner. Partially this decision was based on the realities of the budget, but Keck (and many notable designers) feels that most plants succeed better when put in young so that they can acclimatize more easily to their new surroundings without the abrupt shock of a full-grown transplant.<br><br>Everyone involved agreed that the new yard shouldn't be too precious or pristine. Instead, they wanted an easy, low-maintenance atmosphere--a place where the family could relax, entertain, and spend hours outdoors. Welti transformed the formerly disused space into three highly usable family- oriented areas. A bluestone patio, furnished with vintage outdoor chairs, is a relaxed spot to hang out with friends before dinner. A dining table and chairs sit on a wooden platform partially obscured by a multilevel green barrier of low boxwood, a higher hedge of yew, and a small grove of Japanese maples. The trees create an important sense of enclosure and privacy. Welti was keen on imagining how the family would move back and forth through the yard--hence the cedar boardwalk that unites the different living areas.<br><br>With its reliance on plant-based architecture of trees, long-blooming perennials, and shrubs, the garden is also inexpensive to maintain. Gilpin says he enjoys the small amount of yard work that's required, only a little raking of the planting beds and sweeping of the terrace and boardwalk once a month or so. Welti and Keck visit twice a year to check on how things are growing, determining which plants may need replacing or rejuvenating and giving the hedges a trim. Most blissfully, there is no need for the weekly invasion of the usual sort of mow-and-blow maintenance company that arrives loaded with power tools, cuts the lawn, blasts the grass clippings all over the place before making a hasty exit. That's probably the most valuable and serene design feature an urban garden can have.<br><br>A stone terrace, the most open area of the garden, sits just behind a sleek new addition by Joseph Tanney at Resolution: 4 Architecture. Farther back, a dining table and playhouse are screened from the house by a grove of Japanese maples.<br><br>Gardening with Kids (for Modernists)<br><br>Los Angeles landscape designer Judy Kameon and her husband, Erik Otsea, aren't the sort of parents who go to great lengths to alter their houses or gardens for the sole sake of their child. Their steep garden in the hilly Elysian Park neighborhood of Los Angeles would make many an overprotective parent reach for his or her antianxiety medication. Besides the large, sharp-tipped agaves and a variety of changes in level delineated by walls and concrete steps, there isn't a patch of lawn or a jungle gym in sight. In this case, the dramatic topography has become a playscape in itself--and one that is perfectly safe. "My feeling from the start was that if Ian grew up in this garden, he would know how to act in it," Kameon says of her son. And she has been proved right.<br><br>Ah, California. Landscape designer Judy Kameon and her family, live as much outdoors as in their Los Angeles house. The fairly steep garden is made of terraces traversed by steps that pass under a giant pepper tree. The most radical transformation in the property occurred when the couple built a larger, modernist house designed by architect William Nicholas of Nicholas/Budd Architects on the site of a former artist studio. Instead of tearing down their 1928 stucco bungalow, they decided to keep it as a guesthouse.</p><h2>Landon Snow and the Island of Arcanum (Landon Snow, Book 3)</h2><p>Landon Snow and his sisters join a quest to find the Island of Arcanum, where they seek to free the imprisoned animals of Wonderwood from the Arcans and discover the island&#39;s sinister secrets.</p><p>Landon Snow finds himself on a wild adventure at sea.

This amazing concentration is far greater than any other continent or country, and the Australian species include the largest, most spectacular and unusual representatives of many carnivorous plant groups (particularly sticky-leaved insect-eating plants). Australia also boasts several endemic carnivorous plant genera that occur no where else on earth. Over the past five decades, world renowned botanist Allen Lowrie has travelled across Australia to observe, study and photograph all carnivorous plant species of the continent. His pioneering efforts yielded the discovery and naming of dozens of new species and hundreds of the first photographs ever taken of nearly sixty carnivorous plant taxa. In 1987, Allen Lowrie published the first of a three-volume treatise documenting all Australian carnivorous plants known at that time. When the last book of the set was released in 1998, the three volumes had become the most highly respected, most popular and certainly the most valuable of all carnivorous plant publications produced since Charles Darwin&#39;s pioneering study on the subject that was printed over a century before. All three of Allen Lowrie&#39;s volumes quickly sold out, and continue to be treasured by book collectors across the world and traded for thousands of dollars. During the intervening 25 years since the publication of the original works, Allen Lowrie continued to undertake intensive field observations and he discovered many more new Australian carnivorous plants. He has carefully revised, updated and improved his original books and his life&#39;s work is now complete and released as Carnivorous Plants of Australia Magnum Opus, Volumes 1, 2 and 3. This incredible benchmark study offers a definitive, unparalleled and up-to-date examination of all carnivorous plants currently recognised from the continent of Australia (8 Byblis species; 1 Aldrovanda; 1 Cephalotus; 3 Polypompholx; 3 Nepenthes; 160 Drosera and 60 Utricularia). Carnivorous Plants of Australia Magnum Opus includes twenty three new species, four new hybrids, eleven recombined taxa, two new records for Australia, and eight taxa that have been recalled from synonymy. It also includes a wealth of new information and location data, new observations, unique photographs and new maps that update the original works.</p><p></p><h2>Mr. Food Test Kitchen Guilt-Free Weeknight Favorites</h2><p>Schedules are busy and time is short, but people with diabetes still need healthy meals to stay on track.

In the first book in the Knights of the Silver Dragon series, two young brothers join forces with a brave girl to discover what has happened to the eldest boy's magic teacher. The setting of this light fantasy is vaguely medieval, but the characters mostly use contemporary American idiom (for example,<i> dad</i> and <i>mom</i>). Although the action is fast and schematically logical, offering few surprises, the intended audience may be new enough to fantasy literature that being able to predict twists and outcomes won't prevent them from enjoying the journey. The book doesn't end with a cliffhanger; that's probably good, as different authors will write future volumes in the series.

Basil Greenhill briefly traces the history of the wooden ship through her multiple forms and styles from her prehistoric beginnings to her demise shortly after the First World War.<p> The four central chapters are devoted to describing in detail the building of the most common trading vessel, a simple 100-ton two-masted wooden schooner. Tom Perkins, a master shipwright of great experience, who rebuilt the West Country sailing barge Shamrock for Britain's National Trust and National Maritime Museum, adds technical details in the language of the trade and portrays the life of the men who worked in the yards. In addition, the building of different types of wooden vessels, three- and four-masted schooners and barques in different countries is discussed, from locations as varied as Wales, the Aland Islands of Finland, and Atlantic Canada. To complement the scholarly text by Dr. Greenhill, Sam Manning, a noted maritime illustrator, further explains many of the intricate processes of shipbuilding in his clear and accurate drawings and in his notes. These illustrations are an invaluable source of explanatory detail and are of great historical value.</p><p> Dr. Basil Greenhill, director of the National Maritime Museum (U.K.) 1967 1983, was an internationally recognized authority on maritime aspects of historical studies. He was Chairman of Britain s Advisory Committee on Historic Wreck Sites and of the project to restore and preserve the world's first modern ship, the SS Grew Brittan, in Bristol. He was the author of over forty books and numerous articles on maritime history. He best known book was his two-volume <i>The Merchant Schooners</i>.

Soon after, he settled in California, where he taught himself the law and passed the state bar exam in 1911. The practise of law never held much interest for him, however, apart from as it pertained to trial strategy, and in his spare time he began to write for the pulp magazines that gave Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler their start. Not long after the publication of his first novel, The Case of the Velvet Claws, featuring Perry Mason, he gave up his legal practice to write full time. He had one daughter, Grace, with his first wife, Natalie, from whom he later separated. In 1968 Gardner married his long-term secretary, Agnes Jean Bethell, whom he professed to be the real &#39;Della Street&#39;, Perry Mason&#39;s sole (although unacknowledged) love interest. He was one of the most successful authors of all time and at the time of his death, in Temecula, California in 1970, is said to have had 135 million copies of his books in print in America alone.</p><h2>Farewell to Bosnia</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Kare First Love, Vol. 2 (2)</h2><p>Despite not having been interested in boys in the past, when Karin meets Kiriya she decides to date him, but their relationship is rocky as they are torn apart by jealous friends and brought together by love.</p><p><b>Kaho Miyasaka</b> made her own debut as a cartoonist in the November 1992 <br>extra issue of <i>Shogakun Shojo Comics</i>.

His seminal works include&nbsp;<i>Miracleman&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Watchmen</i>, for which he won the coveted Hugo Award. Never one to limit himself in form or content, Moore has also published novels,&nbsp;<i>Voice of the Fire&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Jerusalem</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;an epic poem,&nbsp;<i>The Mirror of Love.&nbsp;</i>Four of his ground-breaking graphic novels&#x2014;<i>From Hell</i>,&nbsp;<i>Watchmen</i>,&nbsp;<i>V for Vendetta</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>&#x2014;have been adapted to the silver screen. Moore currently resides in Northampton, England.Acclaimed graphic-novelist Moore (Watchmen, 1987; From Hell, 2000) continues his high-concept saga employing classic �adventure-fiction characters banded together to answer threats to the British Empire. This first book of a trilogy spanning nearly a century sees Dracula heroine Mina Murray, H. Rider Haggard&#x2019;s adventurer Allan Quatermain, and new colleagues Raffles (E. W. Hornung&#x2019;s 1890s gentleman thief), Thomas Carnacki (William Hope Hodgson&#x2019;s pre&#x2013;World War I ghost hunter), and Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s ambisexual Orlando investigate shadowy occultists with possibly apocalyptic intentions. Meanwhile, Brecht&#x2019;s Mack the Knife is nabbed for dockside murders of prostitutes as Pirate Jenny warbles vengeance. While the premise of mixing and matching famed fictional figures has lost some of its novelty, the thrill of how adroitly and intelligently Moore does it remains. O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s detailed art matches the intricacy of Moore&#x2019;s design, combining the meticulous line work of period book illustrations and a distinctly modern vitality. Since, after a spat with DC Comics, Moore has taken the series to relatively little Top Shelf, fans who can&#x2019;t find the new League in comics shops will likely turn to libraries. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Room On the Roof</h2><p>Disatisfied with his strict guardian and the declining European community in Dehra Dun, Rusty, an Anglo-Indian boy runs away to live with Indian friends</p><p>Born in Kasauli in 1934, Ruskin Bond grew up in Jamnagar, Dehradun, New Delhi and Shimla.

After earning a law degree in 1906, he worked for most of his adult life at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute in Prague. Only a small portion of Kafka's writings were published during his lifetime. He left instructions for his friend and literary executor Max Brod to destroy all of his unpublished work after his death, instructions Brod famously ignored.Dearest Father,<br><br>You asked me recently why I maintain that I am afraid of you. As usual, I was unable to think of any answer to your question, partly for the very reason that I am afraid of you, and partly because an explanation of the grounds for this fear would mean going into far more details than I could even approximately keep in mind while talking. And if I now try to give you an answer in writing, it will still be very incomplete, because, &nbsp;even in writing, this fear and its consequences hamper me in relation to you and because the magnitude of the subject goes far beyond the scope of my memory and power of reasoning.<br><br>To you the matter always seemed very simple, at least in to far as you talked about it in front of me, and indiscriminately in front of many other people. It looked to you more of less as follows: you have worked hard all you life, have sacrificed everything for your children, above all for me, consequently I have lived high and handsome, have been completely at liberty to learn whatever I wanted, and have had no cause for material worries, which means worries of any kind at all. You have not expected any gratitude for this, knowing what "children's gratitude" is like, but have expected at least some sort of obligingness, some sign of sympathy. Instead I have always hidden from you, in my room, among my books, with crazy friends, or with extravagant ideas. I have never talked to you frankly; I have never come to you when you were in the synagogue, never visited you at Franzensbad, not indeed ever shown any familiy feeling. I have never taken any interest in the business or your other concerns; I left the factory on your hands and walked off; I encouraged Ottla in her obstinacy, and never lifted a finger for you (never even got you a theater ticket), while I do everything for my friends. If you sum up your judgment of me, the result you get it that, although you don't charge me with anything downright improper or wicked (with the exception perhaps of my latest marriage plan), you do charge me with coldness, estrangement, and ingratitude. And, what is more, you charge me with it in such a way as to make it seem my fault, as though I might have been able, with something like a touch on the steering wheel, to make everything quite different, while you aren't in the slightest to blame, unless it be for having been too good to me.<br><br>This, your usual way of representing it, I regard as accurate only in so far as I too believe you are entirely blameless in the matter of our estrangement. But I am equally entirely blameless. If I could get you to acknowledge this, then what would be possible is&#x2014;not, I think, a new life, we are both much too old for that&#x2014;but still, a kind of peace; no cessation, but still, a diminution of your unceasing reproaches.<br><br>Oddly enough you have some sort of notion of what I mean. For instance, a short time ago you said to me: "I have always been fond of you, even though outwardly I didn't act toward you as other fathers generally do, and this precisely because I can't pretend as other people can." Now, Father, on the whole I have never doubted your goodness toward me, but this remark I consider wrong. You can't pretend, that is true, but merely for that reason to maintain that other fathers pretend is either more opinionatedness, and as such beyond discussion, or on the other hand&#x2014;and this in my view is what it really is&#x2014;a veiled expression of the fact that something is wrong in our relationship and that you have played your part in causing it to be so, but without it's being your fault. If you really mean that, then we are in agreement...</p><h2>1000 Dot-to-Dot: Wonders of the World</h2><p>These puzzles will have you wandering the world!<br><br>More sophisticated than the one-dimensional images from your childhood, these dot-to-dot puzzles take about 30 minutes each to complete, and they show you how expressive line work can create tonal shading and depth as each section is completed.

His subject is Sor Juana In�s de la Cruz, the most striking figure in all of Spanish-American colonial literature and one of the great poets of her age. </p><p> Her life reads like a novel. A spirited and precocious girl, one of six illegitimate children, is sent to live with relatives in the capital city. She becomes known for her beauty, wit, and amazing erudition, and is taken into the court as the Vicereine's prot�g�e. For five years she enjoys the pleasures of life at court--then abruptly, at twenty, enters a convent for life. Yet, no recluse, she transforms the convent locutory into a literary and intellectual salon; she amasses an impressive library and collects scientific instruments, reads insatiably, composes poems, and corresponds with literati in Spain. To the consternation of the prelates of the Church, she persists in circulating her poems, redolent more of the court than the cloister. Her plays are performed, volumes of her poetry are published abroad, and her genius begins to be recognized throughout the Hispanic world. Suddenly she surrenders her books, forswears all literary pursuits, and signs in blood a renunciation of secular learning. The rest is silence. She dies two years later, at forty-six. </p><p> Octavio Paz has long been intrigued by the enigmas of Sor Juana's personality and career. Why did she become a nun? How could she renounce her lifelong passion for writing and learning? Such questions can be answered only in the context of the world in which she lived. Paz gives a masterly portrayal of the life and culture of New Spain and the political and ideological forces at work in that autocratic, theocratic, male-dominated society, in which the subjugation of women was absolute. </p><p> Just as Paz illuminates Sor Juana's life by placing it in its historical setting, so he situates her work in relation to the traditions that nurtured it. With critical authority he singles out the qualities that distinguish her work and mark her uniqueness as a poet. To Paz her writings, like her life, epitomize the struggle of the individual, and in particular the individual woman, for creative fulfillment and self-expression. </p></p><p>Sor Juana displays an extraordinary sweep of imagination and intelligence, and it is many things: a biography, a critical study, a re-creation of an era, a meditation of Mexican history, a dialogue of poet with poet, a reflection on the role of the intellectual in the modern world.<b>Octavio Paz</b> is the author of more than forty columes of poetry and prose.</p><h2>Wife of the Gods: A Novel</h2><p>Quartey, Kwei, Wife Of The Gods: An Inspector Darko Dawson Mystery</p><p><b>Book Description</b><br> Lyrical and captivating, Kwei Quartey&#x2019;s debut novel brings to life the majesty and charm of Ghana&#x2013;from the capital city of Accra to a small community where long-buried secrets are about to rise to the surface.<br> <p>In a shady grove outside the small town of Ketanu, a young woman&#x2014;a promising med student&#x2014;has been found dead under suspicious circumstances. Eager to close the case, the local police have arrested a poor, enamored teenage boy and charged him with murder. Needless to say, they are less than thrilled when an outside force arrives from the big city to lead an inquiry into the baffling case.</p> <p>Detective Inspector Darko Dawson, fluent in Ketanu&#x2019;s indigenous language, is the right man for the job, but he hates the idea of leaving his loving wife and young son, a plucky kid with a defective heart. Pressured by his cantankerous boss, Dawson agrees to travel to Ketanu, sort through the evidence, and tie up the loose ends as quickly and as efficiently as possible. But for Dawson, this sleepy corner of Ghana is rife with emotional land mines: an estranged relationship with the family he left behind twenty-five years earlier and the painful memory of his own mother&#x2019;s sudden, inexplicable disappearance. Dawson is armed with remarkable insight and a healthy dose of skepticism, but these gifts, sometimes overshadowed by his mercurial temper, may not be enough to solve this haunting mystery. In Ketanu, he finds that his cosmopolitan sensibilities clash with age-old customs, including a disturbing practice in which teenage girls are offered by their families to fetish priests as trokosi, or Wives of the Gods.</p> <p>This is a compelling and unique mystery, enriched by an exotic setting and a vivid cast. And Inspector Darko Dawson&#x2014;dedicated family man, rebel in the office, and ace in the field&#x2014;is one of the most appealing sleuths to come along in years. </p> <strong>Kwei Quartey on Ghana and <i>Wife of the Gods</i></strong><br> <p><i>Wife of the Gods</i>, a novel, is set in Ghana, where I grew up. It is a land of great disparities: privilege and disadvantage, wealth and poverty, high education and illiteracy. There is also a mixing of cultures that may sometimes clash. For example, contemporary, &#x201c;westernized&#x201d; medical practice contrasts with traditional healing in which treatments combine lotions and potions with the invocations of the gods, the warding off of curses, and the neutralizing of perceived witchcraft. </p> <p>In <i>Wife of the Gods</i>, these cultural webs are woven into a murder mystery. The book title itself conjures up in the mind the connection of the physical, tangible world with a realm in which gods dwell. For some in Ghana, the two coexist in everyday life. In the story, a young woman is murdered and protagonist Inspector Darko Dawson soon discovers that some people believe the death is the work of a curse from the gods, or of witchcraft. Darko is a detective. It&#x2019;s his job to be skeptical, but as he tries to sort through these claims on the path to the shocking truth, his mettle is truly tested. </p> <p>The belief in the supernatural comes to involve Darko in a personal way. His son, Hosiah, suffers from congenital heart disease. The boy&#x2019;s grandmother, and the traditional healer to whom she takes him, both believe that evil spirits are occupying the boy&#x2019;s chest and causing his symptoms. </p> <p>A physician myself, I would have a well-packaged medical explanation of the mechanism of the Hosiah&#x2019;s illness, but the evil spirits theory seeks to clarify the why as well as the how. Wearing my writer&#x2019;s hat, I examine these supernatural notions with curiosity and fascination, realizing that it is as difficult to prove that curses and evil spirits do not exist, as it is to prove they do. </p> <p>It&#x2019;s been popularly said that once you&#x2019;ve been in Ghana, you can&#x2019;t get Ghana out of you. <i>Wife of the Gods</i> is infused with the flavor of the place, the sights and smells, the traditions of drumming, dancing and libation pouring and the disparities of life that I took for granted as I was growing up in Ghana. Those disparities are rich material for the telling of a mystery story.<i>&#x2014;Kwei Quartey</i></p> (Photo � Steve Monez)Kwei Quartey was raised in Ghana by an African American mother and a Ghanaian father, both of whom were university lecturers.

The essence of the Christian faith is not a creed, a code of conduct, or a collection of worship ceremonies. Christian Basics explains how Christianity revolves around the person of Jesus Christ and our relationship to him. What does the Christian believe? Christian Basics presents summaries of Christian beliefs, structured around an affirmation of the three persons of the Trinity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. How does one live as a Christian in a complex world? Jesus summed up God&#39;s moral law in terms of love - not sentimental or selfish, but strong and sacrificial. Christian Basics explains how to build up your spiritual strength through a disciplined life in the Spirit. In the Preface, author John Stott expresses his hope for readers of Christian Basics: &#34;At whatever stage you are in your spiritual journey, I pray that something or other in this little book may help you to &#39;grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&#39;&#34; (2 Peter 3:18)</p><p></p><h2>Basil of Baker Street (Basil of Baker Street ): Basil of Baker Street</h2><p>A mouse who lives in Sherlock Holmes&#39; cellar evolves a daring plan to uncover the identity of a kidnapper</p><p></p><h2>The Masonic Magician: The Life and Death of Count Cagliostro and His Egyptian Rite</h2><p>Count Alessandro Cagliostro was a cult figure in European society in the tumultuous years leading to the French Revolution. As an alchemist, healer, and Freemason, he inspired both wild devotion and savage ridicule, becoming the subject of novels by Alexander Dumas, a drama by Goethe, and Mozart&#x2019;s opera <i>The Magic Flute</i>. But Cagliostro&#x2019;s sincere belief in the magical powers, even the immortality, of what he called the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry made him dangerous enemies, too. In 1789, he was arrested by the Inquisition and condemned to death for heresy.<br>Now, the discovery of a mysterious manuscript found in the Archives of the Grand Lodge of Scotland may shine a light on Cagliostro&#x2019;s secret spiritual teachings, and allow us, finally, a full understanding of his beliefs. <i>The Masonic Magician</i> tells Cagliostro&#x2019;s extraordinary story, complete with the first English translation of the Egyptian Rite ever published. It presents the case made against him (that he was an impostor as well as a heretic), and finds that the Roman Church, and history itself, have done him a terrible injustice. This scholarly account, drawing on remarkable new documentary evidence, reveals that the man condemned was in fact a remarkable visionary and a true champion of Freemasonry and that his teachings have much to reveal to us today.</p><p><b>PHILIPPA FAULKS is&nbsp;</b>an author, ghost writer, freelance editor and journalist.

That the Spanish cedar is a native of the West Indies? That the French mulberry is neither French nor a mulberry? L. H. Bailey, in this basic introduction to botanical nomenclature, reveals the confusion that results from misleading popular names of plants and points out the fun and the advantages of a sound scientific approach. In a few short chapters, he covers virtually every aspect of the subject of how plants get their names and what those names signify.<br>After an opening chapter that discloses the surprising wealth of information that can be learned from a plant&#x2019;s botanical name, the author discusses the work of Carl Linnaeus (1707&#x2013;78), the great Swedish naturalist who is &#x201c;the father of botany.&#x201d; There is a brief history of the chaotic state of the science before it was effectively systematized, with outlines of pre-Linnaean classification schemes, followed by a full analysis of the Linnaean definitions of genus and species, the basis of modern binomial nomenclature. The following chapter, on plant identification, contains a discussion of herbariums and their value to the modern botanist, as well as valuable suggestions for amateur horticulturalists on preparing herbariums and packaging specimens to be mailed for identification purposes. Two successive chapters cover the many rules of nomenclature and focus upon some current problems in the field. Blackberries, potatoes, roses, and the amaryllis are analyzed as four illustrations of areas in which much work remains to be done.<br>The final section of the book is certain to prove very useful to a variety of readers. The author defines scores of common Latin stems and word-endings used in botanical nomenclature and presents a few important rules of pronunciation. Most important of all, he includes a full, 20-page list of generic terms most likely to be met in horticultural literature and 42 pages of common Latin words and their English botanical applications and meanings.<br>A rare combination of enthusiastic prose, well and clearly written, and scientific accuracy, this is an essential handbook for gardeners, amateur botanists, and horticulturalists as well as a superb introduction for beginning students to an important part of the botanical sciences.<br>&#x201c;Carefully presented treatise.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>America.<br></i>&#x201c;Written with knowledge and authority, charm and eloquence and poetic imagination on the varied aspects of the author&#x2019;s specialty.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>New York Times.</i></p><p>A cofounder of the American Society for Horticultural Science, Liberty Hyde Bailey<b> </b>(1858-1954) wrote many scientific works as well as books that explained botany to lay readers.

His old life is gone.</p><p><i>In the Wake</i> is the story of Arvid's first steps toward resuming that life, of his gradual confrontation with everything he lost and ultimately with his own role in the disaster that killed his family.</p><p>Told with the insight and moral force of his countryman Knut Hamsun, <i>In the Wake</i> is the American debut of a treasured European writer.</p></p><p>Per Petterson&#39;s masterful American debut novel is the story of a man whose life stands still after a terrible accident. Spanning an intense period of only a few weeks, &#34;In the Wake&#34; features 43 year-old Arvid, a writer who lost his parents and younger brothers in a ferry accident some years before. It is especially against his repressed memories--of his father and mother, and of his still-living brother--that Arvid must regard and define his own life. As Arvid struggles with memories, existential questions, and a deep sense of the world&#39;s injustice, he remains overwhelmed by grief, and guilt at having survived. Work on his novel stalls as he moves through life in a cold haze. But while Arvid&#39;s only human contact is with his Kurdish neighbor and with a woman whom he glimpses in a flat across the road, it is this routine contact that begins to slowly remind him of the world---of the beauty and humor we can find in the mundane. As he is reminded, his memories begin to return, and he begins to write again. Poignant, restrained, darkly funny, and at times unbearably moving, &#34;In the Wake&#34; takes on terrible tragedy as one man begins to reconnect with the natural world--at times our only source of solace when we&#39;ve been left to survive in the wake.<p><b>Per Petterson</b> was a librarian and bookseller before publishing his first book in 1987. <i>In the Wake</i> was the first of his novels to be published in the U.S. <i>Out Stealing Horses</i>, his second novel, was published by Graywolf Press in 2007.

These works are remarkable for their combination of lofty spiritual philosophy and robust common sense. As we read them, we feel that we are in touch with a man who, in his ecstatic ascents to God, never loses hold of the actualities of human life. In the Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage, he traces the gradual development of the soul through the active life of Christian virtue, the interior life of contemplation, and the superessential life of union with God. The Sparkling Stone further elaborates on some of the more difficult passages in The Adornment, and The Book of Truth was written as a refutation of the accusation that van Ruysbroeck&#39;s work supported a pantheistic and heretical view of the union of the soul with God. Primarily influenced by St. Paul and St. Augustine, van Ruysbroeck was driven to speak out on the mystical life in reaction to the rising of heretical sects in the lowlands of Belgium that were preaching quietism of &#34;the most soul-destroying kind&#34; early in the 14th century.

Locked in a small room on the top floor of a house in Weimar, the most radical and influential of nineteenth-century German philosophers hovers between dream and wakefulness, memory and hallucination, the first person, second, and third, past and present, reliving his brief love affair with feminist Lou Salome, his stormy association with Richard Wagner, and his conflicted relationship with Lisbeth, his radibly anti-Semitic sister. Here is an authoritative portrait of the Nietzsche we know and the Nietzsche we don't. His titantic ego, suppressed, squelched, and sealed up within him, all but unknown to his acquaintances, creates a maniacal and raging giant inside his own skull that is mysterious and unnerving. Both stylistically and formally innovative, the prose in <i>Nietzsche's Kisses</i> is surprising and rich. The result is a vivid, complex experience of Nietzsche's final hours.<br><br><p><br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Lance Olsen</b> is the author of eighteen books of and about innovative fiction.

In the opeining narrative, Nietzsche counts his last hours, doted upon by nurse Alwine and his righteous sister, Lisbeth ("the llama"). Alternately, there are chapters titled by body parts ("Tail," "Bowels") which offer a kind of dreamlike record of Nietzsche's memory, rendered in a stream-of-consciousness second-person. Finally, a more cohesive narrative fills in the details of Nietzsche's life and works backward in time: his travels to Italy, where he fell in love with the unattainable Lou Salome; his waning years as a professor in Turin; his first literary success with <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>, championed by Richard Wagner before their falling out; finally, his youth in Naumburg and his birth as a pastor's son. Fancifully embroidering into the narrative Nietzsche's themes and aphorisms&#x2014;"Every sentence is a kiss"&#x2014;Olsen is a fine and daring writer, equal to the material. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Skolnick and Fyfe, two of the nation&#39;s top experts on law enforcement, use the incident to introduce a revealing historical analysis of such violence and the extent of its survival in law enforcement today.</p><p>Using as a starting point the acquittal of the cops accused of beating Rodney King, Skolnick (Law/Berkeley; House of Cards, 1978) and Fyfe (Criminal Justice/Temple Univ.) explore the reasons for, and suggest some solutions to, police brutality in America. Digging into police culture, the history of police departments, and the polarization of American society into criminal and noncriminal classes, the authors find several explanations for police brutality. Among them are: the narrow outlook of police executives; the insularity of police departments; the emphasis in police culture on military metaphors; and the handing down of the value of violence by higher-ranking cops to street officers. Few would quarrel with Skolnick and Fyfe when they contend that police ``are obliged to acknowledge the law's moral force and to be constrained by it,'' and few will be unconvinced by the authors' demonstration of how vulnerable Americans of all races and classes are to abuses of police power. Encouragingly, though, they conclude that brutality has diminished over the last 20 years as a result of greater minority representation on police forces nationwide. Skolnick and Fyfe make suggestions for reform (like ``community- oriented policing,'' a concept that already seems to have been implemented in many forces) that generally are intended to enhance community participation in policing. They also suggest videotaping police conduct as ``a technical tool deriving from a larger principle of police reform, which is that anything we can do to reduce the insularity of police is a good thing.'' An excellent history and analysis that balances sympathy for the dangers of police work with concern for its victims and with persuasive, if not profound, suggestions for reform. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Berkeley law professor Skolnick and Temple University criminal justice professor and former New York City police officer Fyfe examine the problem of police violence on the street, in crowd control, and in interrogations. Although they believe that police use of excessive force has decreased somewhat in the last 20 years, it is still widespread and is aggravated by the use of the military model, police culture, and methods of police administration. They argue that police agencies need major reforms including greater accountability, openness, and professionalism and would benefit from a new vision of policing. They are troubled by some police definitions of success (based on numbers of arrests versus preventing and solving peacekeeping problems); the view of police work as war rather than enlisting constructive community support; and the mindset of the "divided nation"--police allied with the white middle class against poor inner-city nonwhites. The authors include a detailed discussion of the Los Angeles police (including the Rodney King case) and other urban police departments as well as interesting comparisons with British policing.

The company&#x2019;s fresh-from-grad-school leaders sought more than old notions of success; they wanted to make all the information in the world available to everyone&#x2014;instantly. Google, like the Big Bang, was a singularity&#x2014;an explosive release of raw intelligence and unequaled creative energy&#x2014;and while others have described what Google accomplished, no one has explained how it felt to be a part of it. Until now. <br><br>As employee number 59, Douglas Edwards was a key part of Google&#x2019;s earliest days. Experience the unnerving mix of camaraderie and competition as Larry Page and Sergey Brin create a famously nonhierarchical structure, fight against conventional wisdom, and race to implement myriad new features while coolly burying broken ideas. <i>I&#x2019;m Feeling Lucky </i>captures the self-created culture of the world&#x2019;s most transformative corporation and offers unique access to the emotions experienced by those who virtually overnight built one of the world&#x2019;s best-known brands. <br><br>&#x201c;Edwards does an excellent job of telling his story with a fun, outsider-insider voice. The writing is sharp.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Boston Globe</i> <br><br>&#x201c;An affectionate, compulsively readable recounting of the early years of Google.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><p>Comparing Google to an ordinary business is like comparing a rocket to an Edsel. No academic analysis or bystander&#x2019;s account can capture it. Now Doug Edwards, Employee Number 59, offers the first inside view of Google, giving readers a chance to fully experience the bizarre mix of camaraderie and competition at this phenomenal company. Edwards, Google&#x2019;s first director of marketing and brand management, describes it as it happened. We see the first, pioneering steps of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the company&#x2019;s young, idiosyncratic partners; the evolution of the company&#x2019;s famously nonhierarchical structure (where every employee finds a problem to tackle or a feature to create and works independently); the development of brand identity; the races to develop and implement each new feature; and the many ideas that never came to pass. Above all, Edwards&#x2014;a former journalist who knows how to write&#x2014;captures the &#x201c;Google Experience,&#x201d; the rollercoaster ride of being part of a company creating itself in a whole new universe.&nbsp;<br><br><i>I&#x2019;m Feeling Lucky</i> captures for the first time the unique, self-invented, yet profoundly important culture of the world&#x2019;s most transformative corporation. <br> <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Douglas Edwards</strong> <br> <br> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <b>Why is <i>I&#x2019;m Feeling Lucky</i> different from other books about Google?</b> </p><p><strong> A:</strong> There have been many fine books written about Google and its impact on the world, but all have been told from an outsider&#x2019;s perspective. <i>I&#x2019;m Feeling Lucky</i> is a personal accounting of what it felt like to be part of the company as it grew from sixty people to tens of thousands. I was a forty-one-year-old middle manager thrust into an unfamiliar world ruled by two brilliant founders with a unique management style, and the book details how difficult it was for me to make the adjustment.</p> <p>Personal anecdotes are interspersed with an explanation of the key events in Google&#x2019;s technical development, largely told in the words of those who actually built the systems that made Google work as fast and well as it does. Many of these individuals have remained anonymous until now.</p> <p><i>I&#x2019;m Feeling Lucky</i> is really aimed at those who are interested both in what Google did to ensure success during its formative years and how it felt to be an ill-prepared participant dropped into the heart of an exploding startup.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <b>What is it really like to work with co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin?</b> </p><p><strong>A:</strong> On a personal level, I found them to be pretty easy-going and approachable. Sergey has a wicked sense of humor and Larry always struck me as very sincere. They liked to surround themselves with intelligent, open minded, curious, and energetic people, who were not afraid to challenge their ideas. They always wanted people to think on a grander scale than they typically did and they didn't like people saying "no" rather than "here's a better way to do that." They didn't get hung up on titles, academic pedigree, or tenure at the company if an idea was a good one.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <b>What is the Google workplace like compared to other companies'?</b> </p><p><strong>A:</strong> Compared to every other place I had worked, it was pretty wonderful. We had free meals every day that were as good as any served by the finest local restaurants, great workout facilities, massage therapists and doctors on staff, and an annual ski trip for all employees. On the other hand, the stress and demands were constant and intense. I went through a couple of weeks at the <i>Mercury News</i> during a newspaper circulation war that really challenged me. At Google, it was like that every day for my five years at the company. We were expected to be available every hour of every day and lots of key decisions were made after midnight. If I wasn&#x2019;t there for the discussion, the decision was made without my input.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <b>In the book, you relay some very heated discussions about how Google dealt with user privacy issues. What were the most significant problems, and how did you handle them as one of the chief marketing executives? </b> </p><p><strong>A:</strong> The biggest privacy issue during my time at Google related to the launch of Gmail and the fact that it scanned mail to insert content-related ads in users&#x2019; inboxes. That created a firestorm that engulfed the company and was very hard to extinguish. There were many contributing factors, but at its heart was the fact that engineers knew no person was reading user mail to insert ads and so insisted that there was NO privacy issue. While technically correct, this perspective denied the concerns of users who did not share the same trust and confidence in Google that its engineering staff did. The founders&#x2019; insistence on not acknowledging users&#x2019; fears made it difficult to respond to them in a sensitive manner. Eventually, we were able to get enough Gmail accounts out to journalists and opinion leaders to begin turning the tide, but the process was painful and damaging to Google&#x2019;s brand.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <b>What was it really like behind the scenes of the Google-AOL deal?</b> </p><p><strong>A:</strong> The negotiations with AOL were challenging and unpleasant for those involved from the Google side. AOL had little interest in Google initially, other than as a weapon to wield against Overture&#x2014;the leading supplier of search-related advertising at the time. Overture and Google fought a pitched battle to win the account, which was worth more than a billion dollars in revenue, and threw everything they could at each other as AOL stood above the fray, egging them on.</p> <p>Even as AOL became aware that Google&#x2019;s technology and ad relevance were superior to those of its competitor, and Google&#x2019;s potential for revenue generation was greater, they demanded more and more in terms of outrageous payment guarantees and access to the company&#x2019;s proprietary algorithms. When AOL ultimately signed the contract with Google, Overture tried one last desperate ploy to sabotage the deal.</p> <p>AOL&#x2019;s enormous traffic guaranteed the success of Google&#x2019;s ad network, but as my book details, taking them on as a client was a high risk gamble that could easily have destroyed Google and driven it into bankruptcy.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <b>What do you regard as your most significant accomplishment while at Google?</b> </p><p><strong>A:</strong> From a marketing perspective, I would say it was creating and enforcing a brand architecture that put all of our emphasis on Google itself, instead of on innumerable individual sub-brands. Because of that, the Google name has not been diluted by competing with its own products. The only two exceptions during my time at the company were the social networking experiment orkut and the product search service Froogle. I argued against the latter name and lost, but ultimately Google recognized its mistake and changed the branding to "Google product search," which is what I had recommended.</p> <p>Other areas I was proud to be part of included the company&#x2019;s response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the formulation of Google&#x2019;s corporate credo ("Ten things we&#x2019;ve found to be true"), writing Google&#x2019;s April Fools jokes, and launching a highly visible engineering recruitment campaign.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <b>What should people know about Google that they don&#x2019;t already know?</b> </p><p><strong> A:</strong> People who only know Google as an omnipresent, omniscient online service should realize that the company began as a small group of well-intentioned geeks who truly wanted to make the world a better place. Along the way, the company was forced to confront the reality that the world didn&#x2019;t always see things from the same perspective, but the strength of their convictions led Google&#x2019;s executives to forge ahead regardless. The founders simply didn&#x2019;t have the patience to wait for the rest of the world to figure out that they were right. This hubris was present from the very beginning and is the source of many of Google&#x2019;s current conflicts. <i>I&#x2019;m Feeling Lucky</i> helps readers to understand how that attitude was formed and forged by specific events that occurred early in the company&#x2019;s history. That background will help readers better grasp why Google does things the way it does today.</p> <p></p>HMH&nbsp;hardcover, 2011Previous ISBN 978-0-547-41699-1</p><h2>It&#39;s Halloween (Greenwillow Read-Alone)</h2><p>Ghosts, pumpkins, witches, and black cats abound in original Halloween poems for the beginning reader</p><p><p>Jack Prelutsky is the best-selling author of more than fifty books of poetry, including <em>The New Kid on the Block</em>, illustrated by James Stevenson, and <em>Stardines Swim High Across the Sky</em>, illustrated by Carin Berger.

Spanning sixty years, this deliciously entertaining history uncovers the audacious manner in which many blacks made a place for themselves in an industry that originally had no place for them. <br><br>Through interviews and the personal recollections of Hollywood luminaries, Bogle pieces together a remarkable history that remains largely obscure to this day. We discover that Black Hollywood was a place distinct from the studio-system-dominated Tinseltown&#x2013;a world unto itself, with unique rules and social hierarchy. It had its own talent scouts and media, its own watering holes, elegant hotels, and fashionable nightspots, and of course its own glamorous and brilliant personalities. <br><br>Along with famous actors including Bill &#x201c;Bojangles&#x201d; Robinson, Hattie McDaniel (whose home was among Hollywood&#x2019;s most exquisite), and, later, the stunningly beautiful Lena Horne and the fabulously gifted Sammy Davis, Jr., we meet the likes of heartthrob James Edwards, whose promising career was derailed by whispers of an affair with Lana Turner, and the mysterious Madame Sul-Te-Wan, who shared a close lifelong friendship with pioneering director D. W. Griffith. But Bogle also looks at other members of the black community&#x2013;from the white stars&#x2019; black servants, who had their own money and prestige, to gossip columnists, hairstylists, and architects&#x2013;and at the world that grew up around them along Central Avenue, the Harlem of the West.<br><br>In the tradition of Hortense Powdermaker&#x2019;s classic Hollywood: The Dream Factory and Neal Gabler&#x2019;s An Empire of Their Own, in Bright Boulevards, Bold Dreams, Donald Bogle re-creates a vanished world that left an indelible mark on Hollywood&#x2013;and on all of America.</p><p>Donald Bogle is the foremost authority on African Americans in film. His books&#x2013;which include Dorothy Dandridge; Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, and Bucks and Primetime Blues&#x2013;have won awards and wide critical acclaim. He teaches at New York University&#x2019;s Tisch School of the Arts and the University of Pennsylvania and lives in Manhattan.The Teens<br><br>IN THE BEGINNING<br><br>Among the old-timers, the story went like this: A woman known to everyone as Madame came to California from Kentucky with her children and her husband. But once they were in the Gold Rush State, her husband left her. Desperate to find work, she introduced herself to a movie director named D. W. Griffith. He not only cast her in his movie, but the two became friends for life. And with this woman, called Madame Sul-Te-Wan, Black Hollywood began.<br>Of course, there was more to it than that, but Hollywood always liked a good story, and the tale of Madame Sul-Te-Wan was a good enough place to start. So, too, was the early romance of Los Angeles for all those who journeyed westward.<br><br>Even before the movies, Los Angeles held the promise of a world of endless sunshine and unlimited possibilities. Here was a city with warm days and cool nights, with winding canyons, steep hills, and stately mountains looming large and mysterious on the horizon&#x2014;and not far from a breathtaking view of an ocean that was clear and blue, cool and inviting. Those early pioneers of color who ventured west were as entranced as everyone else. When Los Angeles was founded in 1781&#x2014;as a city of angels&#x2014;by a group of eleven families, it seemed to throw out a welcome mat to people of color. After all, of that founding group&#x2014;forty-four men, women, and children&#x2014;twenty-six were of African descent, black or &#x201c;black Spaniards,&#x201d; as they were sometimes called. In those very early years&#x2014;before California joined the Union in 1850&#x2014;Los Angeles must have seemed like a dazzling confluence of races and cultures, religions and creeds, a heady brew of ambitions and aspirations, of unexpected energies and colorful personalities, a city cut off from the rest of the country and its rules. Here in the wild and woolly West, no one appeared to think much about the races mixing. Interracial marriage was sanctified by the church and the authorities&#x2014;and was commonly practiced.<br><br>Race did not seem to hinder prosperity either. Black Americans were long a part of city legend and lore. That was certainly true of the early landowner and &#x201c;black Spaniard&#x201d; Francisco Reyes, who owned all of the vast San Fernando Valley and in 1793 became the alcalde or mayor of Los Angeles. And of Maria Rita Valdez de Villa, the adventurous granddaughter of two of the black founders of the city, who married a Spanish colonial soldier, Vicente Fernando Villa. After her husband&#x2019;s death in 1841, Maria received the title to his lush, green 4,449-acre ranch known as Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas. In 1854, in the midst of mounting financial pressures, Maria was forced to sell her land&#x2014;and to part with her adobe situated near what later became Alpine Drive and Sunset Boulevard. In time, the stunning Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas that she had loved so intensely became a prime piece of Los Angeles real estate known today as Beverly Hills.<br><br>But of those early pre&#x2013;movie era pioneers, none was better known than a tough-minded former slave girl named Bridget &#x201c;Biddy&#x201d; Mason. Born in 1818, Biddy had been the &#x201c;property&#x201d; of a Mississippi plantation owner&#x2014;and a Mormon convert&#x2014;named Robert Marion Smith, who migrated with his family first to the Utah Territory in 1847 and later to San Bernardino, California. During the two thousand&#x2013;mile trek across country, Biddy&#x2019;s job was to keep the cattle herded together behind the long line of wagon trains, some three hundred by one account. By then, Biddy was married with three daughters, who were said to have been fathered by the noble Mormon Robert Marion Smith.<br><br>In California, Biddy quickly adjusted to her new life and a new sense of identity. Then, one day, Smith informed Biddy and his other slaves that he had decided to return to Mississippi and that they should all prepare for the journey back. Smith may not have realized that California had been admitted to the Union as a free state. But Biddy knew. She went to the local sheriff, made her plea, and petitioned the court to let her remain in California. In 1856, Biddy Mason won freedom not only for herself and her children but also for another slave family. Afterward, she moved to Los Angeles, and the city had its first great black heroine.<br><br>Biddy shrewdly understood that her day-to-day work as a nurse and midwife would not guarantee a secure future for her family and herself. In the West, nothing was more important than land. And in Los Angeles, there was still much of it&#x2014;acres upon acres&#x2014;to be had. Saving her money, she slowly purchased property&#x2014;the first on Spring Street for $250. Before anyone realized it, Biddy Mason had become a woman of means and one of L.A.&#x2019;s first black female landowners. In 1872, she joined twelve other charter members in establishing a place of worship for colored Angelenos, the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles. She donated money to schools and nursing homes, provided aid for flood victims, and carried food to local jails. By the time of her death in 1891, Biddy Mason had a personal fortune of almost $300,000, and her vast real estate holdings constituted what later became downtown Los Angeles.<br><br>In a town where larger-than-life personalities and drive and discipline would be treasured, those early black pioneers, like great movieland production designers, dressed the set for those who followed. Most others would not have such huge holdings. But they&#x2019;d come with vast dreams and visions and a view of themselves just as grand and as audacious. They&#x2019;d also believe that in Los Angeles, any minute you could turn a corner, and something extraordinary might happen. And that always this sunlit city with swaying palm trees and fragrant eucalyptus offered a chance not just for self-advancement but for self-reinvention. What fueled that kind of dream in the early years of the twentieth century was the new medium that startled and delighted almost everyone in the nation: the movies.<br><br>THE MOVING PICTURES ARRIVE<br><br>The movies, of course, transformed Los Angeles from a sleepy western kind of country town into a sprawling metropolis. Eventually enveloped by Hollywood, Los Angeles became a company town that exuded glamour&#x2014;along with extravagance and excess&#x2014;and in time represented the ultimate kind of American success: a place where everybody, in some way or another, felt connected to those magical moving pictures that gleamed and glittered on screens in darkened theaters. And the concept of Hollywood would encompass other areas where movie people lived and worked: Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Burbank, Culver City, Universal City, Westwood, Santa Monica, the San Fernando Valley&#x2014;and for black Angelenos, parts of the city&#x2019;s Eastside and later Westside, in and around a bustling thoroughfare named Central Avenue.<br><br>Originally, movie production had been in the East, with New York at the center. That changed, however, when the Motion Picture Patents Company&#x2014;the huge trust in the East that controlled the patent claims of major companies like Edison, Biograph, Lubin, Path� Exchange, and Vitagraph&#x2014;insisted that no company be permitted to produce, distribute, or exhibit films without its licensing. Huge fees for the use of cameras and other motion-picture equipment covered by their patents forced many independent producers out of the movie business. Other filmmakers moved West, as far away as possible from the reach of the Patents Company. With its citrus groves and its avocados and especially its acres of unspoiled land and its perpetual sunshine, California proved appealing. Here, production could continue outside year-round.<br><br>Among the early filmmakers from the East were Cecil B. DeMille, who arrived in 1913 to shoot The Squaw Man, and director David Wark Griffith, who brought his stock company of New York actors to California&#x2014;during the winter months&#x2014;to shoot scenes for his films as early as 1910. When he began production on his ambitious Civil War epic, originally called The Clansman and later retitled The Birth of a Nation, Griffith knew that California was where his mighty battle scenes had to be filmed and where he could re-create the city of Piedmont, South Carolina, the central setting of his epic.<br><br>By then, Griffith had already established himself as an important director. Born in 1875 in La Grange, Kentucky, and reared in Louisville, David (Lewelyn) Wark grew up hearing stories of the Old South&#x2019;s power and grandeur. From 1908 to 1913, Griffith made 450 films at the Biograph Studios on East Fourteenth Street in New York City. Many had been short one-reelers. But with the four-reel Judith of Bethulia, he began making longer, more ambitious films. Developing an arsenal of techniques that included crosscutting, intercutting, expressive lighting, camera movement, and the close-up, Griffith helped create a syntax for the language of motion pictures. In the fall of 1913, Griffith left Biograph to join Reliance-Majestic. A year later, working on what would be his mighty, racist masterpiece The Birth of a Nation, D. W. Griffith arrived on the West Coast.<br><br>CALL HER MADAME<br><br>So did an ambitious young African American woman, who had been born Nellie Wan in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1873. Her mother, Cleo de Londa, had been a singer; her father, a traveling preacher named Silas Crawford Wan, whom she once said was Hindu. Whether that was true or not was anybody&#x2019;s guess. Later, the story went over well in Hollywood, which loved those people who created their own colorful biographies. &#x201c;My father didn&#x2019;t mount to nothing,&#x201d; she once said. &#x201c;He had the Bible in one hand and all the women he could get in the other.&#x201d; When Silas deserted the family, Nellie&#x2019;s mother was left to fend for herself, working as a laundress for actresses in Louisvi...</p><h2>Rent A Third Grader</h2><p>Brad, Jenny, and Louisa try to come up with ways for their third-grade class to make money so they can save Partner, the police department horse, from being sent to a pet food company</p><p></p><h2>Me and My Big Mouth: Your Answer Is Right Under Your Nose</h2><p>This book will show you how to train your mouth to speak words that will make you overcomers in this life.

He expects the worst, as usual. But they've come to ask for his help. At the peak of the riots, a redheaded woman known as Little Scarlet was found dead. The police fear that their presence in certain neighborhoods could spark a new inferno, so they ask Easy Rawlins to see what he can discover.</p></p><p>Los Angeles, 1965, right after the Watts Riots, six summer days of racial violence--burning, looting, and killing--that followed the routine arrest of a black motorist for drunken driving. Although custodian and unlicensed PI Ezekiel "Easy" Rawlins stayed safely inside during the turmoil, as an African-American male he understands all too well what it was about. "It's hot and people are mad," he explains in Walter Mosley's <i>Little Scarlet</i>. "They&#x2019;ve been mad since they were babies." Even with the rioting finally cooled, police remain on edge. So when a mid-30s, redheaded black woman named Nola Payne--aka "Little Scarlet"--turns up dead in her apartment, strangled and shot and showing signs of recent sexual contact, the cops are reluctant to storm L.A.'s minority community, looking for her murderer, especially since the culprit may well be an injured white man Payne had sheltered, and who's now disappeared. Instead, they ask Easy to see what he can find out about this crime.<p> The case forces Rawlins to address the ethnic tribulations of 1960s America, in microcosm, and his own discomfort with discrimination, in particular.</p><p> </p><blockquote> I spent my whole early life at the back of buses and in the segregated balconies at theaters. I had been arrested for walking in the wrong part of town and threatened for looking a man in the eye. And when I went to war to fight for freedom, I found myself in a segregated army, treated with less respect than they treated German POWs. I had seen people who looked like me jeered on TV and in the movies. I had had enough and I wasn't about to turn back, even though I wanted to. </blockquote><p> But Easy can't tackle this investigation alone; assisting him are the casually homicidal Raymond "Mouse" Alexander, as well as a dogged white detective and a fetching younger woman, who threatens to overturn the settled life Easy has been working toward all these years. Nor can Rawlins wrap the case up easily. Harassed and attacked for his inquiries, he eventually connects Payne's slaying to a homeless man, allegedly responsible for killing as many as 21 black women, all of whom had the bad judgment to hook up with white men.</p><p> <i>Little Scarlet</i>, the eighth Rawlins novel (after <i>Bad Boy Brawly Brown</i>), is unusual for Mosley, because it focuses as much on the credible mechanics of crime-solving as it does on the exposition of character and the exploration of L.A.'s mid-20th-century black culture. Combined with the author's vigorous prose and prowess with dialogue, Easy's promotion to serious sleuth promises great things for what was already a standout series. <i>--J.

His focus is on Madison before he turned thirty-six, the years in which he did his most enduring work: battling with Patrick Henry the most charismatic politician in revolutionary America, whose political philosophy and ruthless tactics eerily foreshadowed those of today's Tea Party over religious freedom; introducing his framework for a strong central government; becoming the intellectual godfather of the Constitution; and providing a crucial role at Virginia's convention to ratify the Constitution in 1788, when the nation's future hung in the balance.<br> Signer's young James Madison is a role model for the leaders so badly needed today: a man who overcame daunting personal issues (including crippling anxiety attacks) to battle an entrenched and vicious status quo. Michael Signer's brilliant analysis of Madison's Method,&#x201d; the means by which Madison systematically destroyed dangerous ideas and left in their stead an enduring and positive vision for the United States, is wholly original and uniquely relevant today.<br></p><p><b>Michael Signer</b> is an author, advocate, political theorist, and attorney.

He lives with his wife and twin boys in Virginia.An important study of the intellectual and psychological development of a young Madison who believed that leaders should forsake self-interest in promoting the common good.&#x201d; <b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>"James Madison would be called a "flip-flopper" in today's political climate. Thank God he changed his mind and concluded that adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was not just good politics but necessary policy. This is just one of the wonderful aspects of James Madison's life that Michael Signer captures so well in this important biography. Our nation owes huge debts to Madison, and today's civic leaders owe a huge debt to Signer for reminding us why." <b>US Senator Tim Kaine</b><br><br>"<i>Becoming Madison</i> is superb. As a native Virginian who grew up going to steeplechase races at Montpelier, the history is lively and engaging. But Michael Signer's greatest contribution is to turn a biography of Madison into a manual on leadership that is as relevant and valuable today as it was 200 years ago.&#x201d; <b>Anne-Marie Slaughter, Director of Policy Planning, U.S. State Department, 2009-2011 and President and CEO, New America Foundation</b><br>"This engagingly written, carefully researched book is the fullest account we have of the development of Madison's thought and statesmanship through the promotion and drafting of the Constitution to the greatest triumph of his life, the ratification of the Virginia Convention of 1788. Signer shows how there, in face-to-face debate with Patrick Henry, Madison proved what John Marshall termed Madison's unmatched ability to convince could overcome Henry's supreme power to persuade. This capacity characterized Madison's style and career in a way that allowed him to become the master philosopher and practitioner of Lincoln's Union 'conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all ... are created equal.' Signer also shows brilliantly how Madison's studies at Princeton under John Witherspoon began an influential and revealing partnership in public spirited citizenship for good government. Altogether the book brings us closer to understanding how Madison became able to be, all things considered, the father of the Constitution." <b>Ralph Ketcham, Maxwell Professor Emeritus of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University, author of <i>James Madison: A Biography</i></b><br><br>"For centuries James Madison has been overshadowed by the more striking and charismatic members of America's founding generation. And Madison's youth has been even less well known than his maturity. Michael Signer goes far toward filling this historical gap with an engaging, insightful account of how the unassuming young Madison became the hero of the Constitution." <b>H. W. Brands, University of Texas at Austin, author of <i>Andrew Jackson, His Life and Times</i> and <i>The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace</i></b><br>"Sound and revealing." <b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"Intellectual history at its finest an essential biography of an essential Founder.&#x201d; <b><i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i></b><br><br>"In this engaging new study, Signer wrestles with the early life and career of James Madison and attempts to explain why Madison remains unheralded among the founding generation. ...

He is the former literary editor of <i>The Wilson Quarterly</i> and lives in Washington, DC.Starred Review. "Many Buddhist books will edify you," Paine writes, "but will any entertain you?" Paine (<i>Re-enchantment: Tibetan Buddhism Comes to the West</i>) here offers up an enthralling anthology of nine Western "writer-adventurers" who journeyed to India, Tibet, Nepal, China and Japan to study the various incarnations of Buddhism. The first five writers, including a disaffected Frenchwoman and a Dutch mystery novelist, tell of their experiences in Asia during the first half of the 20th century, when there were still tantalizing unexplored "white spaces" on the map. They reverently describe a wild and woolly land filled with magic: lamas discoursing via mental telepathy; almost-naked gurus meditating in icy caves for years at a time; Shangri-La landscapes filled with clanging processions of gaily-dressed pilgrims. The book's second half features four contemporary American Buddhist writers such as Sharon Salzberg and Michael Roach. To one degree or another, they also share their experiences in Asia, but these writers' main focus is the interior realm: how Buddhism has affected their own day-to-day emotional and spiritual lives&#x2014;a familiar theme in current Buddhist writing, but one which these writers make fresh. Paine's own contributions are limited to brief introductions, but these are lively and illuminating. Paine's real genius, however, is constructing a cohesive, potent anthology that informs, delights and fires the imagination, a work that both recalls a lost world and illustrates its continued relevance today. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bailey uses solid character development and superior storytelling, rather than violence, to fuel The Dark Lake, and she is off to an excellent start in this launch of a series."&#x2015;<b>Oline Cogdill</b>, <b><i>Associated Press</i></b><br><br>"Readers and critics have compared Bailey's taut storytelling to that of Paula Hawkins... and Gillian Flynn... high praise for this first-time novelist. It's a well-earned analogy."&#x2015;<b><i>The Minnesota Star Tribune</i></b><br><br>"THE DARK LAKE hooked me from page one! Sarah Bailey combines the very best elements in this stunning debut thriller--a troubled detective still trying to find her way as a female investigator, a small town haunted by secrets both past and present, and a beautiful victim whose unsettling allure appears to be her biggest asset and largest downfall.

Highlighting different moments of crisis and how these are reflected and preserved through crucial artworks, it also asks how to make art in the age of Brexit, Trump, and the refugee and climate crises. <i>In Social Forms: A Short History of Political Art</i>, renowned critic, curator, and writer Christian Viveros-Faun� has picked fifty representative artworks&#x2014;from Francisco de Goya&#x2019;s <i>The Disasters of War</i> (1810&#x2013;1820) to David Hammons&#x2019;s <i>In the Hood</i> (1993)&#x2014;that give voice to some of modern art&#x2019;s strongest calls to political action. In accessible and witty entries on each piece, Viveros-Faun� paints a picture of the context in which each work was created, the artist&#x2019;s background, and the historical impact of each contribution. At times artists create projects that subvert existing power structures; at other moments they make artwork so powerful it challenges the very fabric of society. Whether it is Picasso&#x2019;s <i>Guernica</i> and its place at the 1937 Worlds Fair, or Jenny Holzer&#x2019;s <i>Truisms</i> (1977&#x2013;1979), which still stop us in our tracks, this book tells the story behind some of the most important and unexpected encounters between artworks and the real worlds they engage with. Never professing to be a definitive history of political art, <i>Social Forms </i>delivers a unique and compelling portrait of how artists during the last 150 years have dealt with changing political systems, the violence of modern warfare, the rise of consumer culture worldwide, the prevalence of inequality and racism, and the challenges of technology.<br> <br> Artists illustrated include Ai Weiwei, Art Workers' Coalition,&nbsp;Francis Al�s,&nbsp;Banksy,&nbsp;Max Beckmann,&nbsp;Joseph Beuys,&nbsp;Tania Bruguera, Paul Chan, Gustave Courbet,&nbsp;Honor� Daumier,&nbsp;Eug�ne Delacroix,&nbsp;Walker Evans,&nbsp;Shepard Fairey, Theaster Gates, Felix Gonzalez-Torres,&nbsp;Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, George Grosz,&nbsp;Grupo de Artistas de Vanguardia,&nbsp;Guerilla Girls,&nbsp;Philip Guston,&nbsp;Hans Haacke,&nbsp;David Hammons,&nbsp;<i>Charlie Hebdo</i>, Thomas Hirschhorn, Jenny Holzer,&nbsp;K�the Kollwitz,&nbsp;Barbara Kruger,&nbsp;Jacob Lawrence,&nbsp;Rick Lowe,&nbsp;�douard Manet,&nbsp;Robert Mapplethorpe,&nbsp;Kerry James Marshall,&nbsp;Cildo Meireles,&nbsp;Robert Motherwell,&nbsp;Shirin Neshat,&nbsp;Chris Ofili,&nbsp;Jos� Clemente Orozco,&nbsp;Pablo Picasso,&nbsp;Adrian Piper,&nbsp;Pussy Riot,&nbsp;Robert Rauschenberg,&nbsp;Gerhard Richter,&nbsp;Ed Ruscha,&nbsp;Cindy Sherman,&nbsp;The Silence=Death Project,&nbsp;SUPERFLEX,&nbsp;Vladimir Tatlin,&nbsp;J.M.W.

Designs for bibs, ribbon and crazy patchwork, towels, buttons, babywear and bathrobes are provided, and the technique of attaching buttons with bullion stitch to appear as flowers or holly, is introduced. Heirloom sewing and basic sewing skills are also used to piece together other originally-designed items and there are clear patterns and diagrams to follow that are designed to ensure success however modest one&#39;s skills.</p><p>In this publication, originating in Australia, embroidered borders of delicate flowers are created by massing together simple stitches. Detailed explanations, measurements in both metric and inches, and step-by-step drawings are given for such items as a detachable collar, a jewelry roll, and embroidered buttons, all of which are illustrated in the 16 pages of color illustrations found in two inserts. Some projects involve additional machine sewing while others embellish store-bought items, and, occasionally, the lists of materials call for types of embroidery threads that may be difficult to find, but most embroiderers will be undaunted by the challenge of re-creating these techniques. Sweet and old-fashioned, this embroidery style could be combined well with heirloom sewing techniques. Recommended for public libraries serving embroiderers.<br><i>- Judith Yankielun Lind, Roseland Free P.L., N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.A first-time author from Down Under provides an unusual twist to the French knot-chain stitch mode of embroidery. Newman's emphasis is not only on more than 20 projects that can be quickly completed, but also on supplying information beyond simple lists of materials needed. Here, she explains the anatomy of needles and threads (why, for example, certain threads fray more often than others) and demonstrates how heirloom sewing can be accomplished on a machine. Some of the projects consider a stitcher's time constraints, so, for instance, she advocates buying baby T-shirts and pants at retail, then adding the decoration. How-to stitch illustrations and accompanying text could be clearer, but, on the whole, a beginner can follow the instructions for a handmade item. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Mathematics in Art</h2><p>The role of mathematics in art, many photos and illustrations</p><p></p><h2>The Japanese Corpse: A Novel</h2><p>Investigating a case involving a murder in an Amsterdam suburb which is apparently the work of the dreaded yakusa, a Japanese version of the Mafia, Detectives De Gier and Grijpstra are led far afield to the holy city of Kyoto</p><p>Janwillem van de Wetering (1931&#x2013;2008) was born and raised in Rotterdam, but lived most recently in Surry, Maine.

He was the last king canonized during the medieval period, and was both one of the most important saints and one of the most important kings of the later Middle Ages. In <i>Blessed Louis, the Most Glorious of Kings: Texts Relating to the Cult of Saint Louis of France</i>, M. Cecilia Gaposchkin presents six previously untranslated texts that informed medieval views of St. Louis IX: two little-known but early and important vitae of Saint Louis; two unedited sermons by the Parisian preacher Jacob of Lausanne (d. 1322); and a liturgical office and proper mass in his honor&#x2015;the most commonly used liturgical texts composed for Louis&#x2019; feast day&#x2015;which were widely copied, read, and disseminated in the Middle Ages. Gaposchkin&#x2019;s aim is to present to a diverse readership the Louis as he was known and experienced in the Middle Ages: a saint celebrated by the faithful for his virtue and his deeds. She offers for the first time to English readers a typical hagiographical view of Saint Louis, one in counterbalance to that set forth in Jean of Joinville&#x2019;s <i>Life of Saint Louis</i>. Although Joinville&#x2019;s <i>Life</i> has dominated our views of Louis, Joinville&#x2019;s famous account was virtually unknown beyond the French royal court in the Middle Ages and was not printed until the sixteenth century. His portrayal of Louis as an individual and deeply charismatic personality is remarkable, but it is fundamentally unrepresentative of the medieval understanding of Louis. The texts that Gaposchkin translates give immediate access to the reasons why medieval Christians took Louis to be a saint; the texts, and the image of Saint Louis presented in them, she argues, must be understood within the context of the developing history of sanctity and sainthood at the end of the Middle Ages.</p> <p>"With <i>Blessed Louis, the Most Glorious of Kings</i>, M. Cecilia Gaposchkin makes a ground-breaking contribution to the fields of medieval history, hagiography, and historical memory. Of the five main texts she edits and translates here, four are appearing in print for the first time, and none has ever before been translated into English. These exciting new texts give us a fresh understanding of how St. Louis was represented in the century after his canonization." --Sean L. Field, University of Vermont</p></p><p>M.

Then I arrive at my destination: a small house, set back from the street, with a beautiful tree shading the entire front yard. Inside, the air was cool and everything was polished wood, especially the incredible, gigantic desk. That's where he worked. It was awesome.<br><br>Edgar Rice Burroughs had a huge California ranch, and the land eventually became a town, named for Burroughs's most famous character. Burroughs created one of the few heroes everyone knows, and at that desk, he took Tarzan to exotic lands, had him face bizarre creatures and endless, exotic challenges. Those adventures spirit the reader away to a timeless time of action and heroism. And sitting in that office, I was a permanent convert. For me, and for countless others, the legend will never cease. And that's as it should be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Steve Saffel, Senior EditorEdgar Rice Burroughs is one of the world's most popular authors. With no previous experience as a writer, he wrote and sold his first novel--A Princess of Mars--in 1912. In the ensuing thirty-eight years, until his death in 1950, Burroughs produced ninety-one books and a host of short stories and articles. Although he is best known as the creator of the classic Tarzan of the Apes and John Carter of Mars, his restless imagination knew few bounds. Burroughs's prolific pen took readers from the American West to primitive Africa to romantic adventures on the moon, other planets, and beyond the farthest star.<br><br>No one knows how many copies of Burroughs's books have been published throughout the world. It is conservative to say, however, that with translations into thirty-two known languages, including Braille, the number must run into the hundreds of millions. Considering the additional worldwide following of the Tarzan newspaper feature, radio programs, comic magazines, motion pictures, and television series, Burroughs and his works are certainly known and loved by a legion of fans.</p><h2>Adult Jigsaw Puzzle Grant Wood: American Gothic: 1000-Piece Jigsaw Puzzles</h2><p>Part of an exciting series of sturdy, square-box 1000-piece jigsaw puzzles from Flame Tree, featuring powerful and popular works of art.

Not suitable for children under 3 years due to small parts.<br> <b>Grant Wood</b>&#x2019;s image of two stoic Iowa citizens installed in front of their gothic-hinted home has become a classic of modern American art. Modelled by Wood&#x2019;s daughter and a local dentist, the painting offers a defiant statement of prosaic regionalism in a cultural world then dominated by the modernist tendencies of Europe and Russia, a reposte perhaps to the expressive works of Picasso, Kandinsky and their fellows. The folk art of American Gothic presents a familiar world of local history and imbues it with echoes of Old West photography, with proud owners standing awkwardly in front of their pioneer homesteads. Wood, though, appears subtly to undermine the simplicity of the image with darker implications of the gothic window, the tricorn rake, and the severe expressions of the protagonists, which draw the viewer into the more enigmatic world of the long, dark nights of the American gothic countryside.</p><p>Designed and developed at Flame Tree Publishing, independent publisher and creator of fine, illustrated books, journals and art calendars.</p><h2>Swing, Brother, Swing</h2><p>Lord Pastern fired his revolver.

Against her better judgment, Patricia bends the rules and takes the little girl to her own home. Through Emily&#39;s presence in their house, and her penetrating questions about heaven, the Addisons will learn that there is no sorrow so great that faith cannot help you find your way through.

She is professional, but her Midwestern and Southern roots slip into her delivery from time to time (mostly in the thoughts of the female lead character), adding background to the characterization. Her writing isn't as good as her acting--the plot is predictable, the story unfolds slowly, and a number of the phrases are clich�d. But the core story of a child healing a broken family at Christmas is still heartwarming, and she has a fine eye for realistic detail in her descriptions. Sentimental listeners will enjoy evident VanLiere's affection for her characters.

There was a pleasantly satisfied breakfast taste in her mouth of bacon and coffee and possibly croissants. She lifted her chin and the morning sun shone so brightly on the water, she had to squint through spangles of light to see her feet in front of her. Her toenails were each painted a different color. Red. Gold. Purple. Funny. The nail polish hadn&#x2019;t been applied very well. Blobby and messy. Someone else was floating in the water right next to her. Someone she liked a lot, who made her laugh, with toenails painted the same way. The other person waggled multicolored toes at her companionably, and she was filled with sleepy contentment. Somewhere in the distance, a man&#x2019;s voice shouted, &#x201c;Marco?&#x201d; and a chorus of children&#x2019;s voices cried back, &#x201c;Polo!&#x201d; The man called out again, &#x201c;Marco, Marco, Marco?&#x201d; and the voices answered, &#x201c;Polo, Polo, Polo!&#x201d; A child laughed; a long, gurgling giggle, like a stream of soap bubbles. A voice said quietly and insistently in her ear, &#x201c;Alice?&#x201d; and she tipped back her head and let the cool water slide silently over her face.<br>Tiny dots of light danced before her eyes.<br>Was it a dream or a memory?<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know!&#x201d; said a frightened voice. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see it happen!&#x201d;<br>No need to get your knickers in a knot.<br>The dream or memory or whatever it was dissolved and vanished like a reflection on water, and instead fragments of thought began to drift through her head, as if she were waking up from a long, deep sleep, late on a Sunday morning.<br>Is cream cheese considered a soft cheese?<br>It&#x2019;s not a hard cheese.<br>It&#x2019;s not . . .<br>. . . hard at all.<br>So, logically, you would think . . .<br>. . . something.<br>Something logical.<br>Lavender is lovely.<br>Logically lovely.<br>Must prune back the lavender!<br>I can smell lavender.<br>No, I can&#x2019;t.<br>Yes, I can.<br>That&#x2019;s when she noticed the pain in her head for the first time. It hurt on one side, a lot, as if someone had given her a good solid thwack with a baseball bat.<br>Her thoughts sharpened. What was this pain in the head all about? Nobody had warned her about pain in her head. She had a whole list of peculiar symptoms to be prepared for: heartburn, a taste like aluminum foil in your mouth, dizziness, extreme tiredness&#x2014;but nothing about a hammering ache at the side of your head. That one should really have been mentioned, because it was very painful. Of course, if she couldn&#x2019;t handle a run-of-the mill headache, well then . . .<br>The scent of lavender seemed to be coming and going, like a gentle breeze.<br>She let herself drift again.<br>The best thing would be to fall back asleep and return to that lovely dream with the water and the multicolored toenails.<br>Actually, maybe someone had mentioned headaches and she forgot? Yes, they had! Headaches, for heaven&#x2019;s sake! Really bad ones. Fabulous.<br>So much to remember. No soft cheeses or smoked salmon or sushi because of the risk of that disease she never even knew existed. Listeria. Something to do with bacteria. Hurts the baby. That&#x2019;s why you weren&#x2019;t allowed to eat leftovers. One bite of a leftover chicken drumstick could kill the baby. The brutal responsibilities of parenthood.<br>For now, she would just go back to sleep. That was the best thing.<br>Listeria.<br>Wisteria.<br>The wisteria over the side fence is going to look stunning if it ever gets around to flowering.<br>Listeria, wisteria.<br>Ha. Funny words.<br>She smiled, but her head really did hurt a lot. She was trying to be brave.<br>&#x201c;Alice? Can you hear me?&#x201d;<br>The lavender smell got stronger again. A bit sickly sweet.<br>Cream cheese is a spreadable cheese. Not too soft, not too hard, just right. Like the baby bear&#x2019;s bed.<br>&#x201c;Her eyelids are fluttering. Like she&#x2019;s dreaming.&#x201d;<br>It was no use. She couldn&#x2019;t get back to sleep, even though she felt exhausted, as if she could sleep forever. Were all pregnant women walking around with aching heads like this? Was the idea to toughen them up for labor pains? When she got up, she would check it out in one of the baby books.<br>She always forgot how pain was so upsetting. Cruel. It hurt your feelings. You just wanted it to stop, please, right now. Epidurals were the way to go. One epidural for my headache, please. Thank you.<br>&#x201c;Alice, try and open your eyes.&#x201d;<br>Was cream cheese even cheese? You didn&#x2019;t put a dollop of cream cheese on a cheese platter. Maybe cheese didn&#x2019;t actually mean cheese in the context of cream cheese. She wouldn&#x2019;t ask the doctor about it, just in case it&#x2019;s an embarrassing &#x201c;Oh, Alice&#x201d; mistake.<br>She couldn&#x2019;t get comfortable. The mattress felt like cold concrete. If she wriggled over, she could nudge Nick with her foot until he sleepily rolled over and pulled her to him in a big warm bear hug. Her human hot water bottle.<br>Where was Nick? Had he already got up? Maybe he was making her a cup of tea.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try and move, Alice. Just stay still and open your eyes, sweetie.&#x201d;<br>Elisabeth would know about the cream cheese. She&#x2019;d snort in her bigsisterly way and be precise. Mum wouldn&#x2019;t have a clue. She&#x2019;d be stricken. She&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Oh dear, oh no! I&#x2019;m sure I ate soft cheeses when I was pregnant with you girls! They didn&#x2019;t know about that sort of thing back then.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d talk on and on and worry that Alice had accidentally broken a rule. Mum believed in rules. So did Alice actually.<br>Frannie wouldn&#x2019;t know but she&#x2019;d research it, proudly, using her new computer, in the same way that she used to help Alice and Elisabeth find information for school projects in her Encyclopedia Britannica.<br>Her head really did hurt.<br>Presumably this was only the squidgiest fraction of how much labor would hurt. So that was just great.<br>It was not as if she&#x2019;d actually eaten any cream cheese that she could remember.<br>&#x201c;Alice? Alice!&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t even really like cream cheese.<br>&#x201c;Has someone called an ambulance?&#x201d;<br>There was that smell of lavender again.<br>Once, when they were undoing their seat belts, Nick said (in answer to some fishing-for-compliments thing she&#x2019;d just said), &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous, you goose, you know I&#x2019;m bloody besotted with you.&#x201d;<br>She opened the car door and felt sunshine on her legs and smelled the lavender she&#x2019;d planted by the front door.<br>Bloody besotted.<br>It was a moment of lavender-scented bliss, after grocery shopping.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming. I called triple zero! That&#x2019;s the first time in my life I&#x2019;ve ever called triple zero! I felt all self-conscious. I nearly called 911 like an American. I actually punched in the nine. There&#x2019;s proof I watch too much television.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s not, like, serious. I mean, I couldn&#x2019;t, like, get sued or anything, could I?&#x201d;<br>Was that talkback radio she could hear? She hated talkback radio. The callers were always appalled by something. Alice said once that she&#x2019;d never been appalled by anything. Elisabeth said that was appalling.<br>&#x201c;Alice, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Alice?&#x201d;<br>Sultana, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Sultana?<br>Every night, before they went to sleep, Nick talked to the baby through an empty toilet roll pressed to Alice&#x2019;s stomach. He&#x2019;d heard this idea on some radio show. They said that way the baby would learn to recognize the father&#x2019;s voice as well as the mother&#x2019;s.<br>&#x201c;Ahoy!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d call. &#x201c;Can you hear me, Sultana? This is your father speaking!&#x201d; They&#x2019;d read that the baby was the size of a sultana by now. So that&#x2019;s what they called it. Only in private, of course; they were cool parents-to-be. No sappiness in public.<br>The Sultana said it was fine, thanks, Dad, bit bored at times, but doing okay. Apparently he wished his mum would stop eating all that boring green shit and have a pizza for a change. &#x201c;Enough with the rabbit food!&#x201d; he demanded.<br>It seemed the Sultana was most likely to be a boy. He just seemed to have a masculine personality. The little rogue. They both agreed on this.<br>Alice would lie back and look at the top of Nick&#x2019;s head. There were a few shiny silvery strands. She didn&#x2019;t know if he knew about them, so she didn&#x2019;t mention them. He was thirty-two. The silver strands made her eyes blur. All those wacky pregnancy hormones.<br>Alice never talked out loud to the baby. She spoke to it in her mind, shyly, when she was in the bath (not too hot&#x2014;so many rules). &#x201c;Hey there, Baby,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d think to herself, and then she&#x2019;d be so overwhelmed by the wonder of it she&#x2019;d splash the water with the flats of her palms like a kid thinking about Christmas. She was turning thirty soon, with a terrifying mortgage and a husband and a baby on the way, but she didn&#x2019;t feel that different from when she was fifteen.<br>Except, there were no moments of bliss after grocery shopping when she was fifteen. She hadn&#x2019;t met Nick yet. Her heart still had to be broken a few times before he could turn up and superglue it together with words like &#x201c;besotted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Alice? Are you okay? Please open your eyes.&#x201d;<br>It was a woman&#x2019;s voice. Too loud and strident to ignore. It dragged her up into consciousness and wouldn&#x2019;t let her go.<br>It was a voice that gave Alice a familiar irritated itch of a feeling, like too-tight stockings.<br>This person did not belong in her bedroom.<br>She rolled her head to one side. &#x201c;Ow!&#x201d;<br>She opened her eyes.<br>There was a blur of unrecognizable colors and shapes. She couldn&#x2019;t even see the bedside cabinet to reach for her glasses. Her eyes must be getting worse.<br>She blinked, and blinked again, and then, like a sharpening telescope, everything came into focus. She was looking at someone&#x2019;s knees. How funny.<br>Knobbly pale knees.<br>She lifted her chin a fraction.<br>&#x201c;There you are!&#x201d;<br>It was Jane Turner of all people, from work, kneeling next to her. Her face was flushed and she had strands of sweaty hair pasted to her forehead. Her eyes looked tired. She had a soft, pudgy neck Alice had never noticed before. She was wearing a T-shirt with huge sweat marks and shorts and her arms were thin and white with dark freckles. Alice had never seen so much of Jane&#x2019;s body before. It was embarrassing. Poor old Jane.<br>&#x201c;Listeria, wisteria,&#x201d; said Alice, to be humorous.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re delirious,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try and sit up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmmph,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want to sit up.&#x201d; She had a feeling she wasn&#x2019;t in bed; she seemed to be lying flat on her back on a cool laminated floor. Was she drunk? Had she forgotten she was pregnant and got deliriously drunk?<br>Her obstetrician was an urbane man who wore a bow tie and had a round face disconcertingly similar to that of one of Alice&#x2019;s ex-boyfriends. He said he didn&#x2019;t have a problem with &#x201c;say, an aperitif followed by one glass of wine with dinner.&#x201d; Alice thought an aperitif must be a particular brand of drink. (&#x201c;Oh, Alice,&#x201d; said Elisabeth.) Nick explained that an aperitif was a predinner drink. Nick came from an aperitif-drinking family. Alice came from a family with one dusty bottle of Baileys sitting hopefully in the back of the pantry behind the tins of spaghetti. In spite of what the obstetrician said, she&#x2019;d only had a half a glass of champagne since she&#x2019;d done the pregnancy test and she felt guilty about that even though everybody kept saying it was fine.<br>&#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; asked Alice, terrified of the answer. Was she in some seedy nightclub? How could she explain to Nick that she forgot she was pregnant?<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re at the gym,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;You fell and knocked yourself out. Gave me an absolute heart attack, although I was sort of grateful for the excuse to stop.&#x201d;<br>The gym? Alice didn&#x2019;t go to gyms. Had she woken up drunk in a gym?<br>&#x201c;You lost your balance,&#x201d; said a sharp, jolly voice. &#x201c;It was quite a fall! Gave us all a shock, you silly sausage! We&#x2019;ve called an ambulance, so don&#x2019;t you worry, we&#x2019;ve got professional help on the way!&#x201d;<br>Kneeling next to Jane was a thin, coffee-tanned girl with a bleachedblond ponytail, shiny Lycra shorts, and a cropped red top with the words SPIN CRAZY emblazoned across it. Alice felt instant dislike for her. She didn&#x2019;t like being called a silly sausage. It offended her dignity. One of Alice&#x2019;s faults, according to her sister Elisabeth, was a tendency to take herself too seriously.<br>&#x201c;Did I faint?&#x201d; asked Alice hopefully. Pregnant women fainted. She had never fainted in her life, although she spent most of fourth grade practicing, in the hope that she could be one of those lucky girls who fainted during church and had to be carried out, draped across the muscly arms of their PE teacher, Mr. Gillespie.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m pregnant,&#x201d; she said. Let her see who she was calling a silly sausage.<br>Jane&#x2019;s mouth dropped. &#x201c;Jesus, Alice, you are not!&#x201d;<br>Spin Crazy Girl pursed her mouth as if she&#x2019;d caught Alice out being naughty. &#x201c;Oh dear, sweetie, I did ask at the beginning of the class if anyone was pregnant. I would have put you up front near the fan. You shouldn&#x2019;t have been so shy.&#x201d;<br>Alice&#x2019;s head thumped. Nothing anybody said was making sense.<br>&#x201c;Pregnant,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;At this time. What a disaster.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It is not!&#x201d; Alice put a protective hand to her stomach, so the Sultana wouldn&#x2019;t hear and be offended. Their financial situation was none of Jane&#x2019;s business. People were meant to be delighted when you announced a pregnancy.<br>&#x201c;I mean, what are you going to do?&#x201d; asked Jane.<br>For heaven&#x2019;s sake! &#x201c;Do? What do you mean, what am I going to do? I&#x2019;m going to have a baby.&#x201d; She sniffed. &#x201c;You smell of lavender. I knew I could smell lavender.&#x201d; Her sense of smell had been extra strong because of the pregnancy.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my deodorant.&#x201d; Jane really didn&#x2019;t look like herself. Her eyes didn&#x2019;t look right. It was quite noticeable. Maybe she needed to start using some sort of eye cream.<br>&#x201c;Are you all right, Jane?&#x201d;<br>Jane snorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Worry about yourself, woman. You&#x2019;re the pregnant one knocking yourself out.&#x201d;<br>The baby! She&#x2019;d been selfishly thinking about her sore head when she should have been worrying about the poor little Sultana. What sort of a mother was she going to be?<br>She said, &#x201c;I hope I didn&#x2019;t hurt the baby when I fell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, babies are pretty tough, I wouldn&#x2019;t worry about that.&#x201d;<br>It was another woman&#x2019;s voice. For the first time Alice looked up and realized a crowd of red-faced, middle-aged women in sports gear surrounded her. Some of them were leaning forward, staring at her with avid road-accident interest, while others had their hands on their hips and were chatting to one another as if they were at a party. They seemed to be in a small, fluorescentlit room. She could hear tinny music somewhere in the distance, clanking metal sounds, and a sudden burst of loud masculine laughter. As she lifted her head, she saw that the room was filled with stationary bikes, all crammed together and facing the same direction.<br>&#x201c;Although, you shouldn&#x2019;t really be doing exercise that gets your heart rate up too high if you&#x2019;re pregnant,&#x201d; said another woman.<br>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t do any exercise,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;I should do more exercise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You, my girl, couldn&#x2019;t do any more exercise if you tried,&#x201d; said Jane.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d; She looked around at the strange faces surrounding her. This was all so . . . silly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s probably got a concussion,&#x201d; said somebody excitedly. &#x201c;Concussed people are dazed and disoriented.&#x201d;<br>Spin Crazy Girl looked frightened and stroked Alice&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Oh dear, sweetie, YOU MIGHT BE JUST A LITTLE BIT CONCUSSED,&#x201d; she yelled.<br>&#x201c;Ye...</p></p><h2>Legends of the World&#39;s Finest</h2><p>Book by Simonson, Walter</p><p></p><h2>PADI Rescue Diver Manual</h2><p>Used.

For situations when aid-givers don't have the proper supplies, this guide teaches creative and medically sound problem-solving for emergency situations. <p>The easy-to-follow format walks you through "Signs and Symptoms" and "Treatment," and notes "When to Worry" signs for a broad spectrum of medical emergencies. "Tricks of the Trade" sidebars offer improvisational techniques, such as closing wounds with dental floss, hair, or duct tape; treating burns or creating an airtight dressing with honey and plastic wrap; relieving mouth bleeding with a tea bag, and many more.</p></p><p>Auerbach, former editor of Journal of Wilderness Medicine and author of several outdoor medicine books, has updated his classic text, first published in 1986, with instructions for handling almost any medical problem likely to arise. Divided into five sections, this book covers basic first aid, major medical emergencies, minor problems, those specific to particular environments such as high altitude or underwater settings, and miscellaneous topics like transporting the injured and performing procedures. Appendixes include medication dosages and conversion tables. Weiss, an emergency medicine physician and medical editor for Backpacker magazine, has written a compact guide for remote situations where professional medical care is not readily available, diagnosis must be rapid, and treatment may have to be improvised using whatever materials are at hand. Part 1 covers basic techniques such as CPR; Part 2, specific injuries or illnesses. For each problem Weiss lists signs and symptoms, general treatment guidelines, "when to worry" icons recommending prompt evacuation, and "backcountry tips" showing how to use what you have as makeshift medical supplies. Appendixes cover medications, evacuation of the injured, and what to include in a wilderness first-aid kit. Both physicians emphasize the need for preparation and prevention before embarking on any outdoor travel. Auerbach includes topics not covered in the shorter Weiss book, but in general they include much the same material. Both are well illustrated with excellent line drawings demonstrating techniques.

What if she just rode on to the end of the line? Maybe she could find a place where everything was new and she could start all over again.</p><p>But people would ask questions. <i>How old are you? ... Only ten and a half? What are you doing here all by yourself?</i> Someone would be sure to find her and bring her back.</p><p>Anyway, it was too late. Aunt Claudia had already seen her. Aunt Claudia was at the station, looking through the train window and waving.</p><p>Sarah Ida picked up her suitcase.</p><p>"Here, little lady, I&#x2019;ll help you with that," said the porter.</p><p>"I can carry it myself," she said, and she dragged it off the train.</p><p>Aunt Claudia gave her a kiss that smelled like cough drops. Then they took a taxi. They rode through town, and Aunt Claudia talked. "You&#x2019;ve grown, but I knew you the minute I saw you. You&#x2019;ve got your mother&#x2019;s pretty brown eyes, but you&#x2019;ve got your father&#x2019;s jaw. Look &#x2013; over there. That&#x2019;s our new supermarket.

The taxi turned off the avenue and stopped in front of a square, gray house.</p><p>While Aunt Claudia paid the driver, Sarah Ida looked at the house. It was old, with a new coat of paint. It had spidery-looking porches and balconies.</p><p>They went inside.</p><p>"There&#x2019;s the telephone," said Aunt Claudia.

Indeed, some of the natural, holistic, and alternative human medicine being practiced today arose through the observation of wild animals. In this groundbreaking work, Dr. Engel points out fascinating parallels between animal and human medicine. She offers intriguing examples of how animals prevent and cure sickness and poisonings, heal open wounds, balance their diets, and regulate fertility. For instance,<br><br>*chimpanzees carefully eat bitter-tasting plant "medicines" that counter intestinal parasites *elephants roam miles to find the clay they ingest to counter dietary toxins *broken-legged chicks have been known to eat analgesic foods that alleviate pain.<br><br>By observing wild health we may discover (or rediscover) ways to benefit our own health. As Craig Stotlz of the Washington Post noted, this "highly readable assessment . . . triggers more outside-the-double-helix thoughts about human health than anything I've read recently."</p><p>Cindy Engel has a Ph.D. in biology from the University of East Anglia, with a concentration on the relationship between physiology and behavior in animals. She has done research on the behavior and health of wild rabbits and jaguars and for twelve years has been a lecturer in environmental sciences at the Open University. She has published numerous scientific papers, particularly in the prestigious journal Animal Behaviour, and for the past eighteen months has worked as a script writer and science advisor for a series of wildlife documentaries being produced by National Geographic. In addition to her research into the medicinal practices of animals, she has studied holistic medicine for humans and is a Shiatsu practitioner. She has two children, lives on a farm in Suffolk, and is not quite forty.1 HEALTH IN THE WILD The multitude of the sick shall not make us deny the existence of health.<br> Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1860<br><br>The herbalist Juliette de Badracli Levy has spent much of her long life observing the way animals keep themselves well in the wild. In one of her many books she writes, Everywhere in the woods one observes the wild animals rearing their young in health and freedom from sickness.&#x201d;1 But this view is considered naively romantic by wildlife health experts. Although an animal may seem healthy on the surface, it may harbor diseases and parasites that drain its resources and can flare up should resistance falter momentarily. Furthermore, the animals we see are the survivors, disease and death having filtered out the less healthy. The wild animal, from this perspective, fights a perennial battle with sickness and disease.<br> Which view is correct the romantic vision of a healthy and harmoniously balanced ecosystem, or the survivalist vision of a ruthless, endless battle with death and disease? Paradoxically, the two views are not as diametrically opposed as they might first appear. When we see a beautiful swan glide across still water, the movement appears effortless; the swan seems calm and untroubled, even serene. An observer below the water, however, would see that the swan is working hard: muscles are contracting and relaxing; legs and webbed feet are pumping, pushing water aside with great effort. So it is with wild health. While an animal may appear to glide effortlessly through life&#x2019;s troubled waters, a continuous struggle for survival goes on, largely unseen. One perspective, then, is that behind a fa�ade of blissful, harmonious balance, each and every organism is working to maintain its health and to survive. Another perspective is that the struggle and selective survival actually create the impression of harmony. I find no conflict in being able to see both the struggle and the balance in the same vista, but evidently the answer to the seemingly straightforward question How healthy are wild animals?&#x201d; is influenced by the perspective of the observer.<br> Most of us gain our impressions of health in the wild primarily from the news media and news about wildlife, like news about anything, is seldom good news. Currently, wildlife health makes grim reading. Seal and dolphin populations in the Mediterranean and Baltic seas, and in the coastal waters of the United States, have been seriously affected by major disease outbreaks. It looks as if the butylins used to protect the hulls of ships from barnacles and such are the main culprits. These biocidal chemicals damage mammalian immune systems, lowering resistance to disease and cancers. Meanwhile, harbor porpoises in the English Channel and southern North Sea are sickened by the high concentrations of polychlorinated biphenols and mercury in their waters. And a global epidemic of mysterious tumors affecting endangered sea turtles is linked to the pollution of their watery breeding grounds.<br> On land, amphibians around the world are facing a health crisis. Over the past two decades there has been a rapid decline in their numbers, including extinction of some species, apparently because of a global epidemic of a particular fungal infection. Furthermore, the number of grossly abnormal amphibians born has increased. Although the exact causes of this crisis are ambiguous, environmental factors that disrupt both disease resistance and the developmental systems of amphibians may play a role. All the main contenders are caused by humans: global warming, agrochemicals, and damage to the ozone layer.<br> Pollution distorts our impression of wild health, and the occurrence of disease in wild-animal populations has become an important indicator of ecological disruption. For a clearer picture of how animals stay well, we need to assess the health of populations far from the effects of industrial society. But even there our presence can disrupt the survey. Early in the study of wild chimpanzees at Gombe National Park in Tanzania, a polio outbreak decimated the chimpanzees, killing four and leaving six permanently disabled. It is thought that the virus spread from local humans, who suffered a polio outbreak a month before, and was carried inadvertently by vaccinated human scientists. The introduction of new pathogens can be devastating for any population. The Spanish conquistadors of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries killed most of the native Central Americans, not by superior warfare or cunning intellect, but by bringing with them novel and consequently lethal diseases (measles, for one). Today pathogens are traveling the world with increasing ease as the internatiional trade in food, plants, and animals expands, and humans become increasingly mobile. As a result, wildlife is exposed to many new diseases.<br> As thhhhhe human population increases, the need for more and more land for housing, agriculture, and tourism continues to squeeze wildlife into ever-shrinking areas of natural habitat. Asian elephants no longer have enough room to find the food and water they need to stay well. Lions in the Serengeti National Park, along with the last few viable populations of African wild dogs, have been ravaged by canine distemper virus and rabies caught from domestic dogs skirting the edge of the park. William Conway of the Wildlife Conservation Society puts it succinctly: Our growing herds and flocks of domestic animals have become a plague to wildlife, devastating habitat and spreading disease.&#x201d; We hear far more about disease passed in the other direction from wild to domesticated animals. In Europe, wild badgers are blamed by farmers for infecting domesticated cattle with tuberculosis, deer are feared as carriers of foot-and-mouth disease because infected herds can remain symptom free, and wild boar are hounded for spreading classical swine fever (CSF) to commercial pigs because CSF has become milder in wild boar than pigs.&#x201d;3 In North America, free- ranging bison are accused of spreading brucellosis to ranched cattle, and wild deer of spreading tuberculosis to cattle. In what I consider to be a totally illogical response, wild animals successfully keeping disease at bay are often killed in order to protect sickly (but profitable) domesticated livestock from infection. In the United Kingdom, for example, a culling program is currently under way in which twenty thousand badgers will be killed to prevent them from possibly spreading tuberculosis to cattle.<br> This fear of wild animals as harbingers of disease is deeply ingrained in the human psyche. The European hedgehog (small, spiny heroine of a classic Beatrix Potter story) was recently described as among the most dangerous animals in Europe&#x201d; by pathologist Ian Keymer of London Zoo, who found that they carry at least sixteen diseases known to affect people. And those could be the tip of the iceberg,&#x201d; he adds. If we look closer we may find many more.&#x201d; Howard Hughes would have understood, but if we follow this line of reasoning to the extreme, we should never exchange air or body fluids with other people, and we should certainly eradicate all other species on earth just to be safe!<br> Even though wild animals are able to carry diseases that affect livestock and humans, it would seem sensible to explore why they are so successful in fending off the worst effects of these diseases, to look to them for ways of improving our own health and that of our livestock, rather than trying to eradicate them. In addition to looking at genetic resistance to disease, we would do well to learn from the many behavioral self-help strategies that wild animals employ.<br> One difficulty in assessing wild health is locating genuinely wild places where animals are not confined by perimeter fences, culled, managed, or exposed to domestic animals or humans. Where is the wild truly wild? Unfortunately, such habitats are shrinking daily. A survey by the World Wide Fund for Nature found that more than a third of the planet&#x2019;s animal and plant species exist exclusively on a scant 1.4 percent of its land surface.5 Moreover, few places on earth remain uncontaminated by persistent pollutants such as PCBs, dioxins, and DDT. With shrinking habitat and increasing pollution, the opportunity to study undisturbed animal populations is decreasing, while the need to do so becomes ever more urgent.<br> Even when we can find truly wild places, measuring or assessing the health of animals living there is notoriously difficult. Most of the evidence has tended to come from the incidental comments of natural historians and scientists on the health of animals being observed. In the early 1960s George Schaller, of the New York Zoological Society, was the first person to study wild lowland gorillas in West Africa. He found them healthy, lean, well muscled with shiny coats, although he noted that they did catch cold when the rains came. He was surprised to find roundworms in half the fecal samples he examined because the gorillas were in such good health. During the same time, Jane Goodall found wild chimpanzees to be generally healthy, although they too quite often suffered from colds and coughs during the rainy season. In the 1970s Cynthia Moss started her long-term study of elephants in Amboseli National Park and found them in extremely good health. (Things went wrong in later years, though, when human encroachment and drought struck the herds.) They had few diseases and only a few cases of unexplained sickness. They rarely suffered from contagious epidemic diseases, such as rinderpest, and were able to live to a ripe old age as long as they could avoid drought and human hunters.<br> Schaller later went to Kanha, in India, where he found disease rare among free-ranging, well-nourished chital (medium-sized deer) and gaur (wild relatives of the cow). He concluded that the health of domestic and wild hoofed animals is mainly a function of the quality of the range, and that animals in poor condition as a result of malnutrition become highly susceptible to parasites and disease. Similar conclusions have been drawn by wildlife veterinarians, who report that free-living marsupials in Australia have few problems with infectious diseases, parasites, and cancers, unless droughts, floods, or range restriction occur.<br> Unfortunately, anecdotal observations such as these are not adequate to provide an accurate scientific picture of wild health. Sick animals may alter their behavior in ways that make them harder (or easier) to spot than healthy animals. Sick elephants, for example, often separate from the herd to remain near water, shade, and easy food, so an observer might underestimate the prevalence of sickness. Hedgehogs, normally nocturnal, when sick will sit in the sun during the day. A daytime observer might therefore think that hedgehogs were more sickly than they are. More visible populations can be taken as representing a species when this is not necessarily so. Red foxes in the United Kingdom have moved into cities where food is more plentiful and energy rich. These urban foxes live in conditions much more crowded than their rural counterparts, because the food supply is more concentrated. The health of the more visible urban foxes is therefore not an accurate indication of the health of wild foxes in their natural habitat.<br> Fortunately we are now seeing a minor flurry of health assessments of wild animals living in some of the remotest parts of the world, far from human settlements and pollution. In the 1990s the Wildlife Conservation Society&#x2019;s field veterinary program, headed by William Karesh, ascertained that anacondas in Venezuela, macaws in Peru, rock-hopper penguins and guanacos in Argentina, impala in northern Namibia, forest duiker and pancake tortoises in Tanzania, and African buffalo were all in good physical condition.&#x201d; They were muscled and lean, had cleanly healed serious wounds, were harboring surprisingly few internal or external parasites, and showed no signs of physical abnormalities such as those currently seen in amphibians. Blood tests revealed that parrots had few infections with common bird diseases and were successfully carrying avian viruses that commonly wipe out captive parrots. Impala had surprisingly few previous infections with local diseases, and duiker carried serious pathogens such as leptospirosis with no visible ill effects. African buffalo were outstanding in their ability to resist disease: When buffalo encounter viral and bacterial diseases, they generally suffer little.&#x201d; They were in excellent health, yet blood tests revealed that they had been in contact with leptospirosis, parainfluenza, brucellosis, bovine herpes, bluetongue, and foot-and-mouth. As successful combatants of such infections, they were considered carriers&#x201d; of disease and much despised by local cattle farmers.<br> These assessments tend to bear out the earlier observations of Schaller, Goodall, and others that wild animals are often infected with disease-causing organisms (pathogens) without showing any symptoms. Repeatedly, animals appear to be in good condition when blood and fecal tests show infection with pathogens or parasites. We have to conclude that it is normal natural to be infected with low levels of pathogens and parasites in the wild, but that somehow these are kept below symptomatic levels. Benjamin Hart, a veterinary research scientist at the University of California, Davis, concludes that wild animals generally are often immune to vector-borne diseases and show few clinical signs of illness from parasite infections.&#x201d; Whether you consider such animals to be healthy or not depends on whether you think the presence of the pathogen is the same as the presence of the disease. In my view, it is not necessarily the same: to carry pathogens without showing symptoms might be considered a sign of extremely good health. Nor does it matter that these animals are only the survivors that the unhealthy ones simply failed to make it. It is because they are survivors that they are of interest to us. How is that they have survived and maintained their health while others have not? They are not merely survivors; they are doing very well. We should be interested in any behavior that has contributed to this condition.<br> My unsurprising conclusion is that when wild animals are free to range over undisturbed habitat, not exposed to high levels of pollutants and not exposed to extremes of environmental change, they are generally in good health. They live within an ecosystem to which their physiology and behavior are, by virtue of their very survival, well adapted. They have been exposed to local pathogens from an early age, so that their immune system is primed (as it would be by vaccinations) for resistance to them. They may get sick; but when they do, the reason is primarily a strong disruption in their environmental conditions (drought, pollution, lack of food, overcrowding, or invasion by a novel pathogen).<br> Of course, the immune system plays an enormous role in maintaining health, but it is by no means the only line of defense an animal has and it is certainly not independent of behavior. Scientists at Stanford University captured healthy wild African green monkeys and caged them separately to monitor the effects of stress on their immune systems. The monkeys rapidly succumbed to infectious diseases, and some even died despite being given all the nutrients they were thought to need. This is not an isolated case. It is well documented that healthy wild animals do not take readily to captivity. Immune collapse is common. It is notoriously difficult to maintain the health of wild-born gorillas in captivity even if the animals were healthy when caught. White sharks cannot be held captive at all; they die within weeks.12 The health of the immune system is demonstrably interlocked with the animal&#x2019;s behavi...</p><h2>The Crow: The Third Book of Pellinor (Pellinor Series)</h2><p><b>As this enthralling epic nears its climax, the young heroine&#x2019;s brother discovers his own hidden gift &#x2014; and the role he must play in battling the Dark.</b><br><br>Hem is a weary orphan whose struggle for survival ends when he is reunited with his lost sister, Maerad.

He wiped it away and reached for another mango.<br><br>It was so hot. Even in the shady refuge of the mango tree, the air pressed around him like a damp blanket. There wasn&#x2019;t the faintest whisper of a breeze: the leaves hung utterly still. As if to make up for the wind&#x2019;s inaction, the cicadas were louder than Hem had ever heard them. He couldn&#x2019;t see any from where he was, perched halfway up the tree on a broad branch that divided to make a comfortable seat, but their shrilling was loud enough to hurt his ears.<br><br>He leaned back against the trunk and let the sweet flesh of the fruit dissolve on his tongue. These mangoes were certainly the high point of the day. Not, he thought sardonically, that it had been much of a day. He should have been in the Turbansk School, chanting some idiotic Bard song or drowsing through a boring lecture on the Balance. Instead, he had had a furious argument with his mentor about something he couldn&#x2019;t now remember and had run away. <br><br>He had wandered about the winding alleys behind the School, hot and bored and thirsty, until he spotted a seductive glint of orange fruit behind a high wall. A vine offered him a ladder, and he climbed warily into a walled garden, a lush oasis of greenery planted with fruit trees and flowering oleanders and climbing roses and jasmine. At the far end was a cloister leading into a grand house and Hem scanned it swiftly for any occupants, before making a dash for the fountain, which fell back into a mosaic-floored pond in the center of the garden. He plunged his head under the water, soaking himself in the delicious coolness, and drank his fill.<br><br>Then, shaking his head like a dog, he surveyed the fruit trees. There were a fig, a pomegranate, and two orange trees as well as the mango, the biggest of them all. He noted with regret that the oranges were still green, and then swung himself easily into the mango tree and started plundering its fruit, cutting the tough skin with a clasp knife and throwing the large stones onto the ground below him, until his fingers were sticky with juice.<br><br>After he had eaten his fill he stared idly through the leaves at the blue of the sky, which paled almost to white at the zenith. Finally he wiped his hands carefully on his trousers, dragged something from his pocket, and smoothed it out on his leg. It was a letter, written on parchment in a shaky script. Hem couldn&#x2019;t decipher it, but Saliman, his guardian, had read it out to him that morning and then, seeing the look on Hem&#x2019;s face, had given him the letter as a keepsake. <br><br>To Hem and Saliman, greetings!<br><br>Cadvan and I arrived in Thorold safely, as you may know if the bird reached you. We are both much better than when we last saw you.<br><br>I was very seasick on my way here, and Cadvan and I had to fight an ondril, which was very big, but we got here safely. Nerili has given us haven, and you will have heard the rest of the news from the emissary.<br><br>I hope you have arrived in Turbansk with no harm, and that Hem finds the fruits are as big as the birds said they were. I think of you all the time and miss you sorely.<br><br>With all the love in my heart,<br>Maerad<br><br>Already they were being chased by monsters. Hem knew that an ondril was a kind of giant snake that lived in the ocean.Cadvan was possibly even braver than Saliman, and Maerad (to Hem&#x2019;s twelve-year-old eyes at least) was braver still; but they were only two, and the Dark so many, and everywhere. And where was Thorold, after all? Somewhere over the sea, Saliman had told him, and showed him a shape on a chart; but Hem had never even seen the sea and had only the vaguest idea of distance on a map. It meant nothing to him.<br><br>Hem stared at the letter as if the sheer intensity of his gaze could unriddle its meanings, but all it did was to make the page swim and blur. The only word he could make out was Maerad. And what had Maerad not written down? What other dangers was she facing? The letter was already days old: was she still alive?<br><br>Very suddenly, as if it burned him, Hem crumpled up the letter and shoved it back in his pocket. Unbidden into his mind came the memory of when he had first seen Maerad, when she had opened his tiny hiding place under the bed in the Pilanel caravan and he had looked up, terrified, expecting a knife flashing down to slash him to ribbons, and instead found himself staring into his own sister&#x2019;s astonished eyes. Only he hadn&#x2019;t known she was his sister, then. That had come later. . . . He remembered Maerad as he had last seen her in Norloch, standing in the doorway of Nelac&#x2019;s house as he and Saliman rode away, her face white with sorrow and exhaustion, her black hair tossing in the wind. Hem bit his lip, almost hard enough to draw blood. He was not a boy who wept easily, but his chest felt hot with grief. He missed Maerad more than he could admit, even to himself.<br><br>Maerad was the one person in the world he felt at home with. In the short period they had been together his nightmares had stopped for the first time in his life. Even before she knew he was her brother, she had taken him in her arms and stroked his face when the bad dreams came. Even now it seemed amazing; Hem would have hit with his closed fist anyone else who took such liberties. He had trusted Maerad from the start. . . .<br><br>_________</p><h2>Citizenship and Social Class (Pluto Classics)</h2><p>Over forty years after it first appeared, T.H. Marshall&#39;s seminal essay on citizenship and social class in postwar Britain has acquired the status of a classic. His lucid analysis of the principal elements of citizenship -- namely, the possession of civil, political and social rights -- is as relevant today as it was when it first appeared. It is reissued here with a complementary monography by Tom Bottomore in which the meaning of citizenship is re-examined, in very different historical circumstances. In asking how far the prospects for class equality have been realised, Bottomore continues the discussion in a context that encompasses the restoration of civil and political rights in Eastern Europe, problems of welfare capitalism, citizenship and the nation state and the broader issues of equality and democratic institutions.</p><p>T.H.

The Gnostic, the esoteric, the Platonist, or the deist has each been able to find something familiar in the writings. One just had to have a penchant for remote antiquity, for the idea of a Golden Age, in order for Hermeticism, with its aura of an ancient Egyptian revelation, to have enjoyed such outstanding success."&#x2015;from the Introduction</p><p>Hermes Trismegistus, "thrice-great Hermes," emerged from the amalgamation of the wisdom gods Hermes and Thoth and is one of the most enigmatic figures of intellectual history. Since antiquity, the legendary "wise Egyptian" has been considered the creator of several mystical and magical writings on such topics as alchemy, astrology, medicine, and the transcendence of God. Philosophers of the Renaissance celebrated Hermes Trismegistus as the founder of philosophy, Freemasons called him their forefather, and Enlightenment thinkers championed religious tolerance in his name. To this day, Hermes Trismegistus is one of the central figures of the occult&#x2015;his name is synonymous with the esoteric.</p><p>In this scholarly yet accessible introduction to the history of Hermeticism and its mythical founder, Florian Ebeling provides a concise overview of the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i> and other writings attributed to Hermes. He traces the impact of Christian and Muslim versions of the figure in medieval Europe, the power of Hermeticism and Paracelsian belief in Renaissance thought, the relationship to Pietism and to Freemasonry in early modern Europe, and the relationship to esotericism and semiotics in the modern world.</p></p><p>Florian Ebeling is Lecturer at the University of Heidelberg.

Gyurme Dorje is a leading scholar of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, from which the Tibetan Book of the Dead literature derives.<p>The question of whether or not there exists a continuity of consciousness after death has been an important aspect of philosophical reflection and debate from ancient Indian times to the present. When considering these matters from a Buddhist point of view, however, we have to bear in mind that the understanding of the nature of continuity of consciousness and the understanding of the nature of the &#x2018;I&#x2019; or &#x2018;self&#x2019; are closely interlinked. Therefore, let us first look at what it is that can be said to constitute a person.</p><p>According to Buddhist classical literature, a person can be seen as possessing five interrelated aggregates, technically known as the five psycho-physical aggregates.a&nbsp;These are the aggregate of consciousness, the aggregate of form (which includes our physical body and senses), the aggregate of feeling, the aggregate of discrimination, and the aggregate of motivational tendencies. That is to say, there is our body, the physical world and our five senses, and there are the various processes of mental activity, our motivational tendencies, our labelling of and discrimination between objects, our feelings, and the underlying awareness or consciousness.</p><p>Among the ancient schools of thought, which accepted the notion of continuity of consciousness, there were several non-Buddhist philosophical schools which regarded the entity, the &#x2018;I&#x2019; or &#x2018;self&#x2019;, which migrated from existence to existence as being unitary and permanent. They also suggested that this &#x2018;self&#x2019; was autonomous in its relationship to the psycho-physical components that constitute a person. In other words they believed or posited that there is an essence or &#x2018;soul&#x2019; of the person, which exists independently from the body and the mind of the person.</p><p>However, Buddhist philosophy does not accept the existence of such an independent, autonomous entity. In the Buddhist view, the self or the person is understood in terms of a dynamic interdependent relationship of both mental and physical attributes, that is to say the psycho-physical components which constitute a person. In other words our sense of self can, upon examination, be seen as a complex flow of mental and physical events, clustered in clearly identifiable patterns, including our physical features, instincts, emotions, and attitudes, etc., continuing through time. Further, according to Pr&#x101;sa&#x1e45;gika-Madhyamaka philosophy, which has become the prevailing philosophical view of Tibetan Buddhism today, this sense of self is simply a mental construct, a mere label given to this cluster of dependently arising mental and physical events in dependence on their continuity.</p><p>Now, when we look at this interdependence of mental and physical constituents from the perspective of Highest Yoga Tantra,b&nbsp;there are two concepts of a person. One is the temporary person or self, that is as we exist at the moment, and this is labelled on the basis of our coarse or gross physical body and conditioned mind, and, at the same time, there is a subtle person or self which is designated in dependence on the subtle body and subtle mind. This subtle body and subtle mind are seen as a single entity that has two facets. The aspect which has the quality of awareness, which can reflect and has the power of cognition, is the subtle mind. Simultaneously, there is its energy, the force that activates the mind towards its object - this is the subtle body or subtle wind. These two inextricably conjoined qualities are regarded, in Highest Yoga Tantra, as the ultimate nature of a person and are identified as buddha nature, the essential or actual nature of mind.</p><p>Now, before we look more closely at the nature of the subtle body and mind, let us look at how the gross body and mind are thought to originate. The notion of dependent origination lies at the very heart of Buddhist philosophy. The principle of dependent origination asserts that nothing exists in its own right independent of other factors. Things and events come into being only in dependence on the aggregation of multiple causes and conditions. The process through which the external world and the sentient beings within it revolve in a cycle of existence propelled by karmic propensities and their interaction with misapprehension, attraction and aversion and conditions is described in terms of twelve interdependent links. Each cycle of the process begins with a misapprehension of the nature of actual reality. This fundamental ignorance acts as a condition for the arising of the propensities created by our past actions, mental, verbal and physical, which condition our dualising consciousness. Our dualising consciousness, in turn, conditions the qualities and mode of interaction of our psycho-physical aggregates, which condition our sensory fields, which generate contact, which generates sensations, and then in turn attachment, grasping, and maturation towards rebirth. At this point there is an interaction with the genetic constituents of the parents and subsequent interaction with the environment, and then finally we have birth, ageing and death. This cycle can be viewed as both illustrating the underlying processes of life, death and rebirth and as an illustration of the processes to be transformed on the path to liberation from suffering in cyclic existence.</p><p>The notion that there is a connection between this life and the events of both our previous existence and our future existence, follows from the Buddhist understanding of the natural law of cause and effect. For example, although we can speak of yesterday&#x2019;s weather and today&#x2019;s weather as distinct, today&#x2019;s weather is inextricably linked with the weather patterns of yesterday. Even at the bodily level, in the case of our physical health for example, we know that events in the past affect the present and those of the present the future. Similarly, in the realm of consciousness the Buddhist view is that there is also this same causal continuum between the events of the past, present and future.</p><p>The Buddhist understanding of the continuity of personal experience, including our memories, can also be considered here. The Buddhist view is that the continuity of personal experience is primarily founded on the capacity for retention, which can be further developed during one&#x2019;s meditative practice in this life. However, generally speaking, it is thought that if a person dies after a prolonged period of illness that has led to a prolonged degeneration of both physical and mental capacities, there will be a greater chance of many of the personal characteristics, including memories etc., being lost. On the other hand, in the case of someone who dies a sudden death, when the mind-body relationship at the gross level is still very firm, it is thought that there is a greater chance of carrying forward the acquired characteristics and memories, etc. Nonetheless, in both cases, the characteristics carried forward from a previous life are generally thought to be most strongly felt at an early stage of one&#x2019;s rebirth. This is because the personal characteristics of the previous life are thought, generally speaking, to be quickly overwhelmed by the developing characteristics inherited from the parents of the present life. Nonetheless, as I have mentioned, much depends in this respect on the individual&#x2019;s capacity for recall and this capacity for recall is dependent on a deepened retentive training acquired in this lifetime.</p><p>Now, let us look at the possible states of existence one can be born into. From the Buddhist perspective, rebirth in conditioned existence can take place in one of three realms: the formless realm, the form realm or the desire realm. The form and formless realms are fruits of subtle states of consciousness, attained upon the realisation of certain meditative concentrations. Our realm, the desire realm, is the most gross of these three. Six classes of beings are described as inhabiting the desire realm: gods (mundane celestial beings whose primary mental state is exaltation), antigods (who are predominantly hostile and jealous), human beings (who are influenced by all the five dissonant mental states), animals (who are under the sway of delusion), anguished spirits (who are under the sway of attachment and unsatisfied craving) and hell beings (who are overwhelmed by hatred, anger and fear). In the literature of Highest Yoga Tantra, the evolution of all the three realms of conditioned existence are described in terms of differing expressions or states of energy and, as I have mentioned, it is said that our fundamental ignorance is the root of conditioned existence and that karmic energy is its activating force. In the Buddhist view, therefore, it is the nature of our habitual tendencies that generates our future existence, driven by the natural law of cause and effect.</p><p>Further, when we observe the patterns of arising and subsiding that underlie the dynamic nature of the physical environment, the cycle of days and nights and the passing of the seasons, for example, and we observe how matter arises from insubstantial subatomic particles and we look at the patterns of causal connectedness in the arising and dissolution of our mental experiences from moment to moment, across the differing phases of deep sleep, dreams and our waking state, the notion of continuity of consciousness can come to be seen to be in accord with both the nature of our environment and the nature of our mental experience. Certainly, it has often been argued that one advantage of accepting the notion of continuity of consciousness is that it gives us a more profound ability to understand and to explain the nature of our existence and of the universe. In addition, this notion of continuity and causal interconnectedness reinforces a sense of consequences for our own actions, in terms of both the impact on ourselves and the impact on others and the environment.</p><p>So, in summary, when considering the notion of continuity of consciousness we must bear in mind that there are many different levels of greater or lesser subtlety in the states of consciousness. For example, we know of course that certain qualities of sensory perception are dependent on the physical constitution of the individual and that when the physical body dies, the states of consciousness associated with these sensory perceptions also cease. But, although we know that the human body serves as a condition for human consciousness, the question still remains: what is the nature of the underlying factor or essence that accounts for our experience of consciousness as having the natural quality of luminosity and awareness?</p><p>Finally, then, when considering the interrelationship between mind, body and the environment at the subtle level, we know that material things are composed of cells, atoms and particles and that consciousness is composed of moments. That is to say that mind and matter have distinctly different natures and therefore have different substantial causes. Material things come into being based on other material entities such as particles, atoms and cells and the mind comes into being based on a previous moment of mind, which is something that is luminous and has the capacity to be aware. Each moment of awareness therefore depends on a previous moment of awareness as its cause. This is the reasoning upon which Buddhist logic asserts that there is at the level of subtle mind and subtle wind a beginningless continuum of mind and matter.</p><p>It is through reflection on the above themes: the law of cause and effect, dependent origination, the dynamics of our physical environment, and, based on our analysis of the nature of mind, the mode of the arising and subsiding of thoughts, the shifts in the modalities of our consciousness between deep sleep, dreams and our waking state, etc., that the notion of continuity of consciousness may first become established as relevant to the understanding of our current condition. Once the notion of this continuity has been confirmed, through reflection and experience, then it becomes logical to prepare oneself for death and for future existences.</p><p>Now, as to the nature of the actual preparation itself, this will depend on each individual&#x2019;s depth of spiritual aspiration. For example, if an individual is simply seeking a favourable rebirth as a human being, there is no need to engage in a sophisticated meditative path related to the processes of death and rebirth. Simply to live a virtuous life is seen as sufficient. Similarly, in the case of those who are seeking personal liberation from conditioned existence and also in the case of those whose practice is confined to the s&#x16b;tra level of the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na path, their meditative preparation will be limited to ensuring the attainment of successive forms of existence that will be conducive to the continuation of their journey towards enlightenment. For these three kinds of individuals, no actual techniques for utilising the time of death as an essential element of the spiritual path have been set down in the classical Buddhist literature. Nevertheless, since the understanding of the processes of death, the intermediate state and rebirth are crucial to our understanding of the nature of existence, we do find extensive discussion of these three processes, even in the texts which relate to the aspirations of these three kinds of persons.</p><p>It is exclusively in tantra, however, and particularly in Highest Yoga Tantra, that the methods for utilising the processes of death, the intermediate state and rebirth are specifically taught as the basis for achieving liberation from cyclic existence. These methods involve the development of a skilful relationship with certain experiential stages that an individual actually induces with the intention of enhancing spiritual realisation and the fruition of their capacities as a human being.</p><p>Generally speaking, the practices of Highest Yoga Tantra present a spiritual path which enables the individual to attain complete buddhahood within a single lifetime, prior to the moment of death. Yet, for those who are unable to achieve this, it becomes crucial to use the transformative opportunities offered by the naturally occurring processes of death, the intermediate state and rebirth. Hence, in Highest Yoga Tantra, it is not merely the preparation for a more developed future rebirth which is important, but of more fundamental significance is the personal preparation for using one&#x2019;s own death and subsequent states as a means of achieving liberation.</p><p>In the literature of Highest Yoga Tantra, as I have mentioned, the three realms of conditioned existence into which a human being may be born are described in terms of differing expressions or modalities of energy (<i>rlung</i>) and it is said that our fundamental ignorance is the root of conditioned existence and that karmic energy is its activating force. Further, from the tantric perspective, death, the intermediate state and rebirth are also seen as nothing other than differing modalities of karmic energy. The point at which the gross levels of energy are completely dissolved and only the subtle energies remain is death. The stage at which these energies unfold into a more manifest form is the intermediate state, and the stage at which they eventually manifest substantially is called rebirth. Thus, all three states are differing manifestations of energy (<i>rlun...</i></p></p><h2>The Saturdays</h2><p>Four New York City siblings decide to pool their resources so that each can do a special thing on the Saturday that is his turn to receive the combined allowance.</p><p>Elizabeth Enright was born in Oak Park, IL, on September 17, 1909. Her stories do not hide nor dwell on the pain, conflicts and disappointments of childhood but celebrate the joy, pleasure and love that are families.

She lives in Nantucket, Massachusetts.1<br><br> Faye released the tiebacks on her bedroom curtains. With a silky whisper, the heavy, luxurious panels fell together, blocking out the night, turning her bedroom into a private chamber. Crossing the room, she folded back the floral quilt, exposing the crisply ironed ivory linen sheets. She plumped the already puffy pillows, leaning them invitingly against the headboard.<br><br> She paused, listening. Aubrey was still in the bathroom. Always fastidious, she knew he would be especially particular with his grooming tonight.<br><br> Tonight they would make love for the first time.<br><br> She didn&#x2019;t want to be caught admiring herself, but her full-length cheval mirror invited her to appreciate her appearance. The curves of her voluptuous body were enhanced by the drape of her silk nightgown. The slenderest of straps supported a bodice of exquisite lace dipping to reveal her full breasts. The loose cut allowed the material to skim the rest of her body without emphasizing her other bulges. She&#x2019;d kept her long white hair in the low chignon she often wore&#x2014;she was planning, at some appropriate moment, perhaps when she was on top of Aubrey, to reach up with both arms and remove the barrette, so that her hair would tumble down around her shoulders, just as it did on the heroines in romance novels.<br><br> Bringing her face closer to the mirror, she inspected a freckle on her nose. In spite of her straw hat, the work she&#x2019;d done in her garden had let the spring sun darken the small, pea-sized blemish. Because it was on the same level as her eyes, it gave her the unfortunate appearance of having three eyes, so she&#x2019;d had it lasered off a few years ago, even though it wasn&#x2019;t precancerous. Now she&#x2019;d have to do it again. Taken with all the other changes on her face and body, it made her look not just older, but peculiar.<br><br> Water ran in the bathroom. Faye squinted at the mirror. She wore the beautiful gold filigree necklace Aubrey had given her for Christmas this December. Should she remove it? She never wore jewelry to bed. But then, she hadn&#x2019;t gone to bed for this purpose for years. The necklace was very pretty, lying against her chest. It led the eye down to her bosom. She&#x2019;d leave it on.<br><br> Walking around the room, she took up a pack of matches and lighted all the candles she&#x2019;d set out earlier in the day. The candles made eager, almost erotic, little gasps as their wicks took the flame. The sound sent her into a hot flash. Oh Lord, she hoped she didn&#x2019;t have a hot flash while they were making love! She grabbed a perfume bottle and pressed its cool glass against her flaming cheek. Did she have time to get a glass of ice water? Probably. But if she had a drink of water, she&#x2019;d have to get up to pee right in the middle of this long-awaited romantic interlude. No, she couldn&#x2019;t take the chance. She picked up another bottle and held it to her other cheek. Wow, she really was a little radiator. What a shame she couldn&#x2019;t somehow channel all this extra heat into some kind of battery. She could run her house for the winter.<br><br> Aubrey was still in the bathroom. She chided herself for impatience. After all, what was the hurry? She had all evening. All night. But her back hurt from standing all day painting, and her arms and shoulders ached from preparing the light dinner of fish, fruit, and salad. She folded back the covers and slid into bed. Ah, it felt so good to lie down! She chuckled to herself, thinking how sexual cravings changed during a lifetime. In her youth, desire often made it impossible for her to sleep. Now she was in her fifties, and she wasn&#x2019;t sure she could stay awake to make love.<br><br> Well, that was only to be expected, she supposed, now that she&#x2019;d traded her birth control pills for K-Y Jelly. She opened the drawer of the bedside table and took out the new tube she&#x2019;d bought yesterday. When should she put it on? Should she wait and let Aubrey put it on? Would he want to? He was a bit finicky when it came to the earthier parts of being human.<br><br> Which reminded her, she should bring some towels to the bed. Sex was such a messy business, and Aubrey was such a tidy man. The only child of a wealthy family, he&#x2019;d been coddled and fussed over and raised to live up to certain standards of elegance. He was the only man she&#x2019;d ever met who actually owned, and sometimes wore, a cravat. He loved squiring Faye to operas, ballets, concerts, and the many charity events to which he donated generously. Tall, handsome, possessing a thick head of gleaming silver hair, Aubrey was also deeply kind. Faye didn&#x2019;t know that she loved him, but she was terribly fond of him, and thought he was equally fond of her.<br><br> That didn&#x2019;t necessarily equate to sexual passion, but the night they first met, that exciting, surprising spark had been there. One spring evening, at an open house at The Haven, they&#x2019;d begun chatting in front of the art exhibit. Over the course of the evening, they&#x2019;d lingered, feeling more and more drawn to one another. In fact, by the end of the evening, they&#x2019;d found themselves making out in the front seat of Aubrey&#x2019;s Jaguar like a couple of hormone-driven teenagers. Yes, Faye remembered, with a smile and a little shiver, they definitely had been sexually attracted to each other.<br><br> Unfortunately, Aubrey&#x2019;s daughter Carolyn had interrupted them, rapping on the window, nearly snarling at Faye. That had cooled their ardor, and since then, events had conspired to make it difficult, if not impossible, to regain that passion. They were busy people, occupied with family duties and private interests. They were older, and they were less energetic. Furthermore, Aubrey, who was in his early seventies, almost fifteen years older than Faye, had made a brief, bad, marriage to a young gold digger just before he met Faye. While the marriage had been annulled and his fortune safely protected, his self-esteem had been damaged. He knew only too well how sexual desire could get him into trouble.<br><br> Well, everyone at the hot-flash stage came with a burden of history. Faye knew she was one of the lucky ones. She had loved her husband Jack for all the thirty-five years of their marriage. His unexpected death when he was only sixty-four had plunged her into a well of grief. With her daughter and granddaughter around, she&#x2019;d eventually struggled back into a life of something like happiness, and with the help of her Hot Flash Club friends, she&#x2019;d begun to have fun again. They&#x2019;d encouraged her, a year or so after Jack&#x2019;s death, to try dating. What a bizarre quartet of experiences that had occasioned! She snickered now, remembering the four different men and the disastrous dates. At least she&#x2019;d ridden a motorcycle&#x2014;she&#x2019;d always be just a bit proud of that.<br><br> Jack had been the only man she&#x2019;d ever slept with in her life, except for the brief affair she had the year she turned thirty. Back then, Jack had put in eighteen-hour days at a law firm, and Faye had kept house, mothered her baby, and organized the obligatory cocktail parties. Zeke, an old friend, just back from leading a hiking tour in New Zealand, had seemed like freedom, danger, fresh air. He didn&#x2019;t love her, he didn&#x2019;t even care for her&#x2014;he was just furiously sexually attracted to her. When they made love, it was fierce and completely physical. Kindness, trust, love, and the responsibilities of family weren&#x2019;t in the same room&#x2014;they weren&#x2019;t even in the same universe.<br><br> Remembering those few, brief, crazy meetings brought a smile to Faye&#x2019;s face, and then&#x2014;oh, damn!&#x2014;another hot flash! This one was accompanied by its familiar comrade, irrational crankiness. Why was Aubrey taking so long? She huffed in exasperation. In a way, it seemed rather cold, making love this way, after they&#x2019;d performed their necessary ablutions, but Aubrey was easily embarrassed by the indignities of age.<br><br> The bathroom door opened. Finally! Faye&#x2019;s heart did a little salsa step and she sat up, smiling.<br><br> &#x201c;Sorry to be so long,&#x201d; Aubrey apologized. &#x201c;Candlelight. How nice.&#x201d;<br><br> He was completely naked as he came toward the bed, and Faye gave him full points for courage. She wasn&#x2019;t ready to walk naked in front of him. With her clothes on, she felt attractive, and she wondered briefly whether it would be possible for her to keep her nightgown on while they made love.<br><br> Aubrey slid into the bed next to her. He was in excellent shape for a man in his seventies, yet beneath his silver chest hair, little pouches of fat hung, and Faye was glad. They lay side by side, smiling at each other.<br><br> Aubrey put a warm hand on Faye&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;You look very elegant.&#x201d;<br><br> She blinked in dismay. &#x201c;I look like an elephant?&#x201d;<br><br> Aubrey laughed. &#x201c;I said,&#x201d; he repeated carefully, enunciating each word, &#x201c;you look very elegant.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Faye laughed, too, relieved. Great, I&#x2019;m going deaf, too, she thought.<br><br> Aubrey moved his hand, gently slipping the nightgown strap down her arm. The lace bodice folded delicately over, revealing her breast.<br><br> Aubrey said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re beautiful, Faye.&#x201d;<br><br> Leaning forward, he kissed her. His mouth tasted of both mint and cinnamon, and Faye was slightly amused at all his careful grooming, but as they moved together, touching with hands and mouth and lips and teeth different parts of each other&#x2019;s body, she was glad he smelled so very good, so clean, and slightly spicy. As he delicately explored her, bits of her body woke up, like plants lifting their faces to the sun after a long winter. Now she was glad he moved so slowly.

Including its full text in an appendix, Schall expands upon its themes. Thirteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus' "offensive" words concern the first, religiously motivated violence and the nature of God. The second theme is the loss of European Christian identity; the third, the "dehellenization" of the West. Benedict frames all three issues as matters of reason and religion. Crucial to his argument is the realization that, because of the Incarnation, Christianity doesn't conceive of God as dealing unreasonably with humanity, and as it is unreasonable to force religious belief, violence for religious ends is proscribed. Making the other themes urgent is the educational practice of reserving reason for secular disciplines only, which is why, Schall thinks, the pope made his remarks where and to whom he did. The university and professors can help reverse dehellenization by reconnecting reason and religion in teaching. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Not only does the British chef's book offer 150 attractive recipes and step-by-step instructional color photographs--it classifies the world's seafood in a thorough, approachable, and up-to-date way. This is no small accomplishment. Fish classification is notoriously vexed; local usage can result in multiple names for the same fish--one person's dolphinfish is, for example, another's mahi mahi--or dozens of different fish with the same name. Grouping seafood by anatomical distinctions, such as billfish (which includes swordfish and marlin), as well as by family, helps create a clearer picture; and color illustrations, plus a valuable chart that delineates common, Latin, and family names, as well as home-region, further elucidates what's what and where. <p> In addition, the oversize book's technical illustration, which delves far beyond the usual guide to filleting, skinning, and the like, is an informative trove. Preparing flatfish for broiling <i>and</i> for deep frying are two examples of this thoroughness that also covers baking whole fish in foil; butterflying raw shrimp for broiling; and preparing raw, smoked, and, cured fish, among other key methods. The central section of the book is devoted to Stein's recipes, which range from the simple and direct, like Baked Sea Bass with Roasted Red Pepper, Tomatoes and Anchovies, and Saut�ed Soft-Shell Crabs with Garlic Butter, to the more dressy, such as Fillet of Bass with Vanilla Butter Vinaigrette and Mussels en Croustade with Leeks and White Wine. Offered with suggestions for using alternative fish types, the formulas also help readers make sense of seafood&#x2019;s bounty--and to find recipes based on market availability.

To the outsider, samba and the famous pre-Lenten carnival of which it is the centerpiece seem to showcase the country's African heritage. Within Brazil, however, samba symbolizes the racial and cultural mixture that, since the 1930s, most Brazilians have come to believe defines their unique national identity. <br>But how did Brazil become "the Kingdom of Samba" only a few decades after abolishing slavery in 1888? Typically, samba is represented as having changed spontaneously, mysteriously, from a "repressed" music of the marginal and impoverished to a national symbol cherished by all Brazilians. Here, however, Hermano Vianna shows that the nationalization of samba actually rested on a long history of relations between different social groups--poor and rich, weak and powerful--often working at cross-purposes to one another. <br>A fascinating exploration of the "invention of tradition," <i>The Mystery of Samba</i> is an excellent introduction to Brazil's ongoing conversation on race, popular culture, and national identity.<br><br></p><p>"This very readable book provides an interpretation of an aspect of the Brazilian culture that has remained unexplored until now."-- <i>Choice</i> <br>&#34;The Mystery of Samba&#34; examines a major aspect of Brazilian popular culture and its relation to the formation of national identity in Brazil. Hermano Vianna, a social anthropologist, explains that the transformation of the Brazilian samba into the national music of Brazil was part of the effort by &#34;transcultural mediators&#34; to &#34;invent&#34; a Brazilian identity and to promote the myth of racial democracy. Essentially, Vianna&#39;s is a postmodern interpretation that situates the &#34;invention&#34;of Brazil&#39;s national music in the popular culture and intellectual life of the early twentieth century.</p><h2>The Torso</h2><p><p>Praise for <i>Detective Inspector Huss</i>:</p> <p>"Absorbing, intelligent holds its own alongside the best feminine hardboiled novels currently being written by Englishwomen Val McDermid and Liza Cody, and our own Sara Paretsky."-Maureen Corrigan, NPR, <i>Fresh Air</i> and <i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p> <p>"A truly satisfying police procedural."-<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p> <p>"Another winner."-ALA <i>Booklist</i></p> <p>Part of a human torso washes up on a beach near Göteborg, Sweden.

But the innocent and impulsive Swami lands in trouble when he is carried away by the more serious unrest of India in 1930. Somehow he gets himself expelled from two schools in succession, and when things have gone quite out of hand he is forced to run away from home ...This is far more than a simple narrative of Swami&#39;s adventures - charming and entertaining as they are. By the delicate sympathetically observed, the author establishes for us the child&#39;s world as the child himself sees it: and beyond, the adult community he will one day belong to - in Swami&#39;s case, the town of Malgudi, which provides the setting of almost all Narayan&#39;s later novels.</p><p>R. K. Narayan&#39;s writing spanned the greatest period of change in modern Indian history, from the days of the Raj with Swami and Friends (1935), The Bachelor of Arts (1937) and The English Teacher (1945), to recent years of political unrest - The Painter of Signs (1976), A Tiger for Malgudi (1983), and Talkative Man (1987). He has published numerous collections of short stories, including Malgudi Days (1982) and Under The Banyan Tree (1985), and several works of non-fiction. His most recent work is The Grandmother&#39;s Tale: Three Novellas (1993). R.K. Narayan died in 2001.1. Appropriate for children of all ages and adults too. 2. Extremely engaging.. 3.

Captures your imagination and reminds you of childhood days. The language is simple and the humor is in good taste. Makes you wonder about one's own childhood and the author's insight of the things done during that period. Definitely a good buy. --Nagendra on Jun 17, 2012</p><h2>The Burning Road</h2><p>Ann Benson's debut novel, <b>The Plague Tales</b>, was acclaimed by critics and embraced by readers, who have made it an ongoing national bestseller. Now she has written a spellbinding new novel that sweeps from fourteenth-century France to America in the year 2007--interweaving two gripping stories and two extraordinary eras. In this brilliantly imagined work of fiction, the author revisits the lives of two of her characters, physicians who are separated by centuries but united in their quest to uncover medicine's deepest secrets.<br><br>In fourteenth-century France, a nation is still reeling from its loss to the English at Poitiers, one of the bloodiest battles of the Hundred Years' War. Pockets of plague still dot the countryside as physician Alejandro Canches struggles to make his way to safety, accompanied by his foster child, Kate--the illegitimate daughter of Edward Plantagenet. Enter Guillaume Karle, an educated member of France's rising bourgeoisie, who takes a shine to Kate, and becomes her protector when she and Alejandro are separated. Their struggle to reunite, stymied by circumstance and history, leaves both their fates hanging in the balance.<br><br>Nearly seven hundred years later, in the year 2007, Janie Crowe--surgeon, scientist, dedicated historian--finds herself drawn into the intrigue of an unexplained and debilitating genetic disease. Enlisted by a mysterious young woman to help unlock its secrets, she seeks the wisdom of an ancient text for guidance against this terrible scourge, risking her future and her life for the sake of a greater good.<br><br>Skillfully weaving the strands of these two gripping stories, interlaced with characters historic and imagined, Ann Benson has written a fascinating historical thriller that is also an intricate journey into the mysterious secrets of science: engrossing, thought-provoking, compulsively readable.</p><p>Readers of Ann Benson's bestselling <i>The Plague Tales</i> will bond immediately with this sequel and its unusual blend of historical romance and futuristic medical thriller. The book begins in 14th-century France--a country ravished by a war with the English, and also suffering from the deadly effects of the plague. A Spanish-Jewish physician named Alejandro Canches searches for a cure; he scribes a medical manuscript along the way.<p> <i>The Burning Road</i> then moves to a town in Massachusetts in the year 2007, where another Doctor, Janie Crowe is fighting her own battle to cure sickness and disease. She looks to Canches's manuscript, his "Book of Cures," for clues.</p><p> Benson skillfully shows us the small details of everyday life and the events that both connect and separate these two doctors as they struggle with medical and personal problems. Canches seems to have isolated the cause of the bubonic plague, but his work is interrupted by battles with French troops and by worries about the safety of his foster daughter Kate (who is the illegitimate daughter of England's King Edward III). Meanwhile, Dr. Crowe is on the verge of a major breakthrough with a terrible genetic disease that afflicts Jewish boys.</p><p> The alchemy and magic may not be for every taste, but by linking her two physicians through 600 years of what passes for progress, Benson gives her strange hybrid a uniquely gripping aura. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Praise for <i>The Plague Tales</i>:<p>"[A] cleverly narrated saga...chock full of curious lore and considerable suspense."<br>--<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p>"First-novelist Benson reveals a formidable talent as she blends historical fiction with a near-future biothriller."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"A carefully woven page-turner from which veterans like Robin Cook and Michael Crichton could learn...

Nivola</b>, painter, sculptor, and illustrator, lives in Newton Highlands, Massachusetts.<br>Kindergarten-Grade 3. A little girl in Germany shares every moment of her life with her beloved doll, Elisabeth, until the soldiers come and her teacher calls her "Jew." She flees with her parents to Italy, France, and, finally, America with all the family's possessions left behind, including Elisabeth. Years pass and the little girl, now a mother, has a daughter who wants a special doll. Searching through every antique store, the woman finds the very one she left behind, identifiable because of teeth marks left in the doll's arm by her mischievous dog. Still more years pass and now her granddaughter plays with it. Full-color paintings bordered by white space present a tableaux of images: a stern faced doll, a soldier with a rifle on a sunny tree-lined street, the grown-up Ruth examining the doll in the shop. This is a moving, but adult-focused remembrance of the author's mother, which raises the question of audience. The delicate art, amount of white space, and very brief text will appeal to preschoolers through first graders, but with no background built into the story, they're unlikely to understand why Ruth and her family must flee or comprehend the concept of anti-Semitism. Older children will find the story lacking in substance.?Susan Pine, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jane Eyre</h2><p>Orphaned into cold charity at the hands of her rich cousins and later at Lowood School, Jane escapes to take up a position as governess to the young ward of Mr. Rochester. Their love affair, Jane&#39;s discovery of Rochester&#39;s secret - hideously concealed in the attic of Thornfield Hall - and her desperate flight are told in a drama of passionate intensity whose pace never slackens.</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction.Charlotte Bronte's impassioned novel is the love story of Jane Eyre, a plain yet spirited governess, and her arrogant, brooding Mr. Rochester. Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine--one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved. Hailed by William Makepeace Thackeray as "the masterwork of great genius," <i>Jane Eyre</i> is still regarded, over a century later, as one of the finest novels in English literature.</p><h2>Franny, Queen of Provincetown</h2><p>Franny spends her life in Provincetown, Massachusetts as a teacher, surrogate parent, and friend of troubled gay men, battling their loneliness and ostracism from the world</p><p>This reissue of Preston's classic gay novel adds a sequel to the events depicted in the 1983 edition. As Preston wrote in an epilogue, "Franny is the history of the development of the gay community." And what a chronicle it is, as the changing attitudes of and toward gays are wittily, often poignantly recorded by drag queen Franny and assorted pals and paramours. As in the original edition, these wry, first-person observations begin in 1950-"people say the word queen and expect you to run away and hide. Well to hell with them," declares the eponymous narrator-and conclude in 1983, with Franny older but not wiser. Wisdom has always been Franny's short suit-admonishing a young queen, "Don't you ever look back. Don't you ever." In what is identified as "a working draft" for a sequel, "Franny, Isadora &amp; the Angels," the time is 1993, and Franny turns his Provincetown haven into a refuge for those stricken with AIDS. Like the chapters before it, this obviously unfinished material is achingly funny and sad, and chockablock with humanity. Readers of all sexual persuasions will agree that less is once again more in this affecting work, which serves as a bittersweet epitaph for Preston, who died of AIDS in May 1994. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Paddler&#39;s Guide to Everglades National Park</h2><p><p>"After hundreds of hours of actual experience in the field, which can&#x2019;t be beat, Molloy has written a much-needed guide to paddling the waterways of Everglades National Park--good, practical knowledge and common sense in a folksy, down-home style that is easy to read and follow."--Jeff Ripple, author of <i>Southwest Florida&#x2019;s Wetland Wilderness: Big Cypress Swamp and the Ten Thousand Islands</i></p><p>For the ultimate adventure by canoe or sea kayak, this guide to paddling the Everglades offers detailed information about every significant paddling route in Everglades National Park.

Gold standard of ARTISANAL bread baking in the United States, based in Berkeley, California, and founded in 1983 by former CHEZ PANISSE busboy and house hunk Steve Sullivan, who was inspired to try his hand at baking while reading ELIZABETH DAVID&#x2019;s <i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i> during an overseas bike trip in his college years.

Spanish chef of appropriately surrealist, Dali&#x2013;esque mien who functions as a lightning rod in the Food Snob debate over whether MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY is bracingly innovative or overwhelmed by gimmickry. The popularizer of the vegetable FOAMS that reviewers loved in Spain in 1998 but jadedly condemn in America now, Adria, who operates out of a coastal Catalan resort called El Bulli (The Bulldog), combines a DayGlo aesthetic with a FERNAND POINT fealty to getting the most flavor out of his ingredients, resulting in such weird&#x2013;ass but surprisingly edible creations as a sardine skeleton enshrouded in cotton candy and skinless green&#x2013;pea raviolis that look like Dr. Seuss egg yolks. <i>I clocked some </i>Ferran Adri�<i> influence in those fruit soups that we sucked down from medical syringes</i>.<br><br><b>Affinage</b>. The process whereby young cheese is refined and matured, usually in a cave or climate&#x2013;controlled chamber. The anointed cheese-coddler, known as an affineur, rotates the cheese and beats, brushes, and/or washes it until it is a point and ready to be savored. In the latest manifestation of cheese&#x2013;course mania, some American restaurateurs now employ their own affineurs, though no one has yet made the logical, inevitable step of marketing home affinage units in the vein of SUB&#x2013;ZERO wine&#x2013;storage units.<br><br><b>Asian street food</b>. Increasingly chic trope-inspiration among chefs and restaurateurs (e.g., Jean&#x2013;Georges Vongerichten and Anthony Bourdain) who have eaten their way through Saigon, Rangoon, Singapore, Bangkok, and Jakarta, and have somehow decided that they have seen the future of all cuisine. <i>My new place will combine Viennese-bordello decor with a menu inspired by </i>Asian street food<i>&#x2014;pho, satays, potstickers, all that shit</i>.<br><b>Bain-marie</b>. Overwrought term for &#x201c;double boiler,&#x201d; deployed especially by retailers trying to sell expensive, purpose&#x2013;built double&#x2013;pot sets to status&#x2013;hungry home cooks, even though it&#x2019;s easy to improvise a bain&#x2013;marie with garden&#x2013;variety roasting and sauce pans. Oddly, the <i>marie</i> part of the term (<i>bain</i> is simply French for &#x201c;bath&#x201d;) comes from an ancient alchemist known as Mary the Jewess, who believed that using a double boiler&#x2019;s indirect heat simulated the natural processes by which precious metals formed.<br><br><b>Baum, Joe</b>. Brash, cigar&#x2013;chomping aphorist&#x2013;restaurateur (1920-1998), beloved by restaurant professionals, unknown to laypeople, and therefore a god to Snobs. Working first for the New York hospitality company Restaurant Associates and later on his own, Baum was adamant that fine dining in America didn&#x2019;t have to be toe&#x2013;the&#x2013;line French, a vision that he sometimes executed successfully (the Four Seasons, Windows on the World) and sometimes not (the Roman&#x2013;themed Forum of the Twelve Caesars, featuring gladiator helmets as ice buckets, and the Newarker, a white&#x2013;linen restaurant romantically set in...Newark Airport). A reliable quote machine for food journalists (e.g., &#x201c;When in doubt, flambe&#x201d;), Baum is often credited with/blamed for coining the word <i>foodie</i>. <i>The boob&#x2013;like double pineapple upside&#x2013;down cake with Medjool dates for nipples was vintage Baum</i>.<br><br><b>Beebe, Lucius</b>. Poncey, immaculately turned&#x2013;out American society writer and gourmand of the screwball&#x2013;comedy era (1902-1966), best known for his florid <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> columns of the 1930s and &#x2019;40s, in which he recounted his social adventures as a walker par excellence and his elaborate feasts at gouty Gilded Age&#x2013;throwback hotel dining rooms. Though verbose to the point of lunacy (&#x201c;The good life continues unabated in Hollywood even as in the days of hammered silver handset telephones and the first fine floodtide of early ordovician Goldwynisms&#x201d;), Beebe was one of the first name writers to take fine dining seriously as a subject, earning him the grudging respect of Snobs.<br><br><b>Berkshire pork</b>. Upmarket pork from purebred swine of British pedigree, redder in flesh, more marbled in texture, and richer in flavor than standard, bland American pork (which is justly described as &#x201c;the other white meat&#x201d;). In the nineteenth century, some Berkshire pigs were exported to Japan as a diplomatic gift from the Brits, resulting in the pork&#x2019;s popularity there under the name Kurobuta (&#x201c;black pig&#x201d;), a term unnecessarily bandied about by American butchers and restaurateurs looking for a WAGYU&#x2013;like profit margin. <i>Everything on the menu tonight is outstanding, but I&#x2019;d especially recommend the loin of Berkshire pork with chestnuts and apple</i>&#x2013;<i>Calvados chutney</i>.<br><br><b>Blumenthal, Heston</b>. Yobbish&#x2013;looking but floridly intellectual English practitioner of MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY. Besotted with the works of HAROLD McGEE, Blumenthal, an untrained cook who opened a modest bistro called the Fat Duck in a Berkshire village in 1995, started fiddling with his food as his confidence grew, pairing white chocolate with caviar, fashioning a &#x201c;sardine on toast&#x201d; sorbet, and using a liquid&#x2013;nitrogen bath to prepare a frozen green&#x2013;tea quenelle with lime foam. Result: his first Michelin star in 1999, and three stars by 2004. Less resolutely molecular than the futurist FERRAN ADRIA and the self-serious Grant Achatz of Chicago, Blumenthal writes a column for the <i>Sunday Times</i> of England in which he provides tweaked, home&#x2013;achievable recipes for such traditional dishes as spaghetti bolognese, fish and chips, and black forest cake.<br><br><b>Butter-poached lobster</b>. Sumptuous lobster preparation popularized by THOMAS KELLER at the French Laundry in the 1990s and since imitated, CRUDO&#x2013;style, by restaurants across the land. The lobster is par&#x2013;cooked, its meat removed from the shell, and then the meat is finished off in a pan, where it cooks slowly and gently in a water&#x2013;butter emulsion, or beurre monte, resulting in an even richer dining experience and suggestive MOUTHFEEL than the normal boiled lobster with drawn butter. <i>The saffron risotto was topped off with a curled tail of butter&#x2013;poached lobster: &#x201c;Unnhh,&#x201d; groaned my blissful companion after her first bite</i>.<br><b>Cardoon</b>.

Though Car�me is a necessary namecheck for any Snob who purports to know his culinary history, he is often cited in Snob discourse in unflattering counterpoint to French chefs of later eras. <i>The Troisgros brothers unabashedly embrace peasant fare; not for them the lofty pretensions of&nbsp;</i>Car�me.</p><h2>Sonoran Desert Wildflowers: A Field Guide to the Common Wildflowers of the Sonoran Desert, Including Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, Saguaro National ...

The book recounts the eventful history of the mountain, which since 1902 has been the site of some of mountaineering's supreme achievements. Coupled with these tales of adventure from two expert climbers are the stunning photographs of Bradford Washburn, who has conquered McKinley three times. <p>120 illustrations, 41 in full color, 8 maps, 10 3/8 x 12"</p></p><p>At 20,320 feet, Mt. McKinley, the highest mountain in North America, presents a formidable challenge to climbers and has claimed more than 60 lives. Washburn, retired director of the Boston Museum of Science, noted cartographer and a member of the third party to reach the summit (1942), produced stunning aerial photographs and finely detailed maps that opened new routes for climbers. Roberts made his first ascent as a college student in 1963. Together and alternately, they here recount adventures--successes, failures, tragedies--on the slopes of Mt. McKinley (Denali is its Indian name). The years 1904-1913 saw explorers and prospectors rather than experienced climbers: a trio of sourdoughs reached the top of North Peak (19,450) in 1910, wearing ordinary winter clothing and carrying only walking sticks and a shovel. Frederick Cook made a false claim for the summit in 1906; Hershel Parker and Belmore Brown were forced down by a storm in 1912; Henry Karstens and Charlie McGonagall took summit honors the following year. The 1930s brought intensive exploration and mapping activities aided by the use of ski planes. In the postwar period, climbers flocked to McKinley from all over the world, attempting new routes, going solo and in winter. During the summer of 1990, 600 climbers crowded up to the summit. Dramatic photographs and lively tales make this volume a rare momento of the mountain. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Claudio Bravo: Recent Work (May 6th through June 7, 2008)</h2><p>Exhibition from May 6 through June 7, 2008.

His covers were generally poster-like and free of excess words, and yet these pictures say plenty. The list of subjects is stellar: Marilyn Monroe, Norman Mailer, Muhammad Ali, Andy Warhol, Germaine Greer, and Richard Nixon. Sometimes the picture is a tease for the story within, sometimes it subverts it (as in the cover of a hangdog Roy Cohn with a ridiculous halo that accompanied a self-justifying piece written by Cohn).

This imposition of foreign textualities, however dominant, is never complete because the absences of the disappeared still linger manifestly, still are present. That apparent paradox results in a haunted America, whose conquest is always partial and whose conquered are always contestatory. </p><p>Readers of scholarship by transatlanticists such as Paul Gilroy and hemispherists such as Diana Taylor will find new conceptualizations here of an America that knows no geographic boundaries, whose absences are collective but not necessarily interrelated by genealogy. The five principal texts at hand - Columbus's diary of his first voyage, the Popol Vuh of the Maya-K'iche', Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Evita's Cuando los Combes luchaban (the first African novel in Spanish), and Pynchon's Mason &amp; Dixon - are examined as foundational stories of America in their imaginings of its transatlantic commencement. Interspersed too are shorter studies of narratives by William Carlos Williams, Rigoberta Mench�, �lvar N��ez Cabeza de Vaca, Jos� Mart�, Mark Knopfler (former lead singer of Dire Straits) and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez. These texts are rarely if ever read together because of their discrete provenances in time and place, yet their juxtaposition reveals how the disjunctions and ruptures that took place on the eastern and western shores of the Atlantic upon the arrival of Europeans became insinuated as recurring and resistant absences in narratives ostensibly contextualized by the Conquest.</p><p>The book concludes by proposing that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is the great American novel.</p><p>After Specters of Conquest: Indigenous Absence in Transatlantic Literatures, America will never seem the same.</p></p><p>Adam Lifshey is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Georgetown University.<p>An outstanding work whose strong suits are brevity and originality, range,<br>and attention to the original texts.</p> (&#x2015;Elizabeth Horan <i>Arizona State University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;. . . there is much that is new in Lifshey&#x2019;s book. First in responding to 'the transatlantic turn' in American studies especially the hemispheric reach of such works as Diana Taylor&#x2019;s The Archive and the Repertoire (2003), Lifshey conceptualizes his subject very broadly and, if we accept his premises, coherently. His book 'posits &#x2018;America&#x2019; as not a particular country or continent or hemisphere bus as a reiterating foundational narrative in which a conqueror arrives at a shore determined to overwrite local versions of humanity, culture, ecology and landscape with inscriptions of his own design' (1). The outcome of 'the Conquests' is that we are all, worldwide, Americans now.&#x201d; (<i>&#x2015;Journal of American Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Specters of Conquest will be of interest to scholars in literary and cultural studies; its evocative and simple style makes it accessible to the general public as well. Lifshey offers a fascinating project that engages with spatial considerations, both hemispheric and transatlantic...

When Hanna Perlstein and her mother, Sidonia, come to Springfield, Massachusetts from a displaced persons camp after World War II, they know no one in America. With no other family, except each other, they build a world that revolves around Sidonia&#x2019;s extraordinary talent with a needle and thread to create beautiful garments while Hanna serves as her dutiful model. As Sidonia becomes well-known in western Massachusetts and northern Connecticut for her remarkable sewing talent, she continues to keep her inner secrets about her past hidden not only from her daughter but from everyone else. Determined to craft a life of pride, self-reliance and perseverance, Sidonia teaches her daughter to &#x201c;stand up straight&#x201d; in fashion and in life. Sidonia&#x2019;s Thread uses sewing metaphors to tell the tale of these two women as though stitched together like a handmade garment. Why did Sidonia keep these significant life secrets, and why was Hanna so afraid to ask about them? When Sidonia moves to elderly housing, Hanna steals some of her old letters and photographs hoping to find clues to her paternity, her mother&#x2019;s reclusive behavior, and her heritage. Combined with a trip to her mother&#x2019;s Hungarian homeland and a phone conversation with her father, Hanna&#x2019;s surprising discoveries inspire a revised view of her life with her mother, replacing her conflicting emotions toward her mother with true reverence.</p><p>Hanna Perlstein Marcus, who was born in a displaced persons camp in Germany after World War II, is a licensed social worker who has worked for local governments in various neighborhoods in Connecticut for over thirty years.

Stuart Hughes</h2><p>The author reminisces about his sheltered upbringing, education, experiences during World War II, State Department tenure, and his careers as an educator and politician</p><p>In an urbane, wryly self-deprecating autobiography, 74-year-old Harvard historian Hughes recounts a life that has straddled the worlds of politics and academia and genteel society. This grandson of a U.S. chief justice gathered political intelligence in Algiers and Italy during WW II. As a State Department official, he had a ringside seat as the Cold War was taking shape in 1945-1947. He battled with zealous Washington Cold Warriors, and did preliminary studies for what later became the Marshall Plan. After an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts in 1962, he became an activist, campaigning for disarmament and women's rights, and against the Vietnam War. These crystal-clear yet emotionally reticent recollections do not fully explain why his first marriage to a French Calvinist failed. Hughes is on firmer ground when recalling friendships with Edmund Wilson, Herbert Marcuse, historians Richard Pipes and Richard Hofstadter.

Now a professor emeritus at University of California, San Diego, he candidly describes his privileged boyhood, careers in the army and at the State Department at the beginning of the Cold War, and academic life at Harvard, Stanford, and San Diego. He also brings honesty and perception to his description of two marriages and the liberal impulses that took such forms as his antinuclear campaign for the U.S. Senate and his feminist commitment to his spouse's professional standing (they left Harvard when the history department refused to promote her) before two-career couples were an academic norm.

In this magisterial overview, Niels Peter Lemche surveys the development of the historical-critical method and the way it changed the scholarly perception of the Old Testament. He describes the rise and influence of historical-critical approaches and traces their decline and fall. Then, he discusses the identity of the authors of the Old Testament, based on the content of the literature they wrote, demonstrating that the "collapse of history" does not preclude critical study. Lemche goes on to investigates the theological consequences of this "collapse" and surveys Old Testament and biblical theology in its various manifestations in the twentieth century.

He lives in Victoria, British Columbia, with his family.<b>From <i>The Woman in the Thames: Part One</i><br><br><i>1885</i><br><i>London</i></b><br><br>He was the oldest son.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore his black moustaches long in the manner of an outlaw and his right thumb hooked at his hip where a Colt Navy should have hung. He was not yet forty but already his left knee went stiff in a damp cold from an explod�ing Confederate shell at Antietam. He had been sixteen then and the shrapnel had stood out from his knee like a knuckle of extra bone while the dirt heaved and sprayed around him. Since that day he had twice been thought killed and twice come upon his would-be killers like an avenging spectre. He had shot twenty-three men and one boy outlaws all and only the boy&#x2019;s death did not trouble him. He entered banks with his head low, his eyebrows drawn close, his huge menacing hands empty as if fixed for strangling. When he lurched aboard crowded street�cars men instinctively pulled away and women followed him with their eyelashes, bonnets tipped low. He had not been at home more than a month at a stretch for five years now though he loved his wife and daughters, loved them with the fear a powerful man feels who is given to breaking things. He had long yellow teeth, a wide face, sunken eyes, pupils as dark as the twist of a man&#x2019;s intestines.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He loathed London. Its cobbled streets were filthy even to a man whose business was filth, who would take a saddle over a bed and huddle all night in a brothel&#x2019;s privy with his Colt drawn <br> until the right arse stumbled in. Here he had seen nothing green in a month that was not holly or a cut bough carted in from a countryside he could not imagine. On Christmas he had watched the poor swarm a man in daylight, all clutched rags and greed; on New Year&#x2019;s he had seen a lady kick a watercress girl from the step of a carriage, then curse the child&#x2019;s blood spotting her laces. A rot ate its way through London, a wretchedness older and more brutal than any he had known in Chicago.<br> He was not the law. No matter. In America there was not a thief who did not fear him. By his own measure he feared no man living and only one man dead and that man his father. <br> &nbsp;<br>It was a bitter January and that father six months buried when he descended at last into Bermondsey in search of an old opera�tive of his father&#x2019;s, an old friend. Wading through the night&#x2019;s fog, another man&#x2019;s blood barnacling his knuckles, his own busi�ness in London nearly done.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was dressed like a gentleman though he had lost his gloves and he clutched his walking stick in one fist like a cudgel. A stain spotted his cuffs that might have been soot or mud but was not either. He had been waiting for what passed for morn�ing in this miserable winter and paused now in a narrow alley at the back of Snow Fields, opera hat collapsed in one hand, frost creaking in the timbers of the shopfronts, not sure it had come. Fog spilled over the cobblestones, foul and yellow and thick with coal fumes and a bitter stink that crusted the nos�trils, scalded the back of the throat. That fog was everywhere, always, drifting through the streets and pulling apart low to the ground, a living thing. Some nights it gave off a low hiss, like steam escaping a valve.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Six weeks ago he had come to this city to interrogate a woman who last night after a long pursuit across Blackfriars Bridge had leaped the railing and vanished into the river. He thought of the darkness, the black water foaming outward, the slapping of the Yard sergeants&#x2019; boots on the granite setts. <br><br>He could still feel the wet scrape of the bridge bollards against his wrists.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had been living lawful in this city as if to pass for respectable and in this way absolve herself of a complicated life but as with anything it had not helped. She had been calling herself LeRoche but her real name was Reckitt and ten years earlier she had been an associate of the notorious cracksman and thief Edward Shade. That man Shade was the one he really hunted and until last night the Reckitt woman had been his one certain lead. She&#x2019;d had small sharp teeth, long white fingers, a voice low and vicious and lovely.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The night faded, the streets began to fill. In the upper windows of the building across the street a pale sky glinted, reflected the watery silhouettes below, the passing shadows of the early horses hauling their waggons, the huddled cloth caps and woollens of the outsides perched on their sacks. The iron-shod wheels chittering and squeaking in the cold. He coughed and lit a cigar and smoked in silence, his small deep-set eyes predatory as any cutthroat&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a time he ground the cigar under one heel and punched out his hat and put it on. He withdrew a revolver from his pocket and clicked it open and dialed through its chambers for something to do and when he could wait no longer he hitched up one shoulder and started across.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> If asked he would say he had never met a dead nail didn&#x2019;t want to go straight. He would say no man on the blob met his own shadow and did not flinch. He would run a hand along his unshaved jaw and glower down at whatever reporter swayed in front of him and mutter some unprintable blasphemy in flash dialect and then he would lean over and casually rip that page from the reporter&#x2019;s ring-coil notebook. He would say lack of education is the beginning of the criminal underclass and both rights and laws are failing the country. A man is worth more than a horse any day though you would never guess it to see it. The cleverest jake he&#x2019;d ever met was a sharper and the kindest jill a whore and the world takes all types. Only the soft-headed think a thing looks like what it is.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In truth he was about as square as a broken jaw but then he&#x2019;d never met a cop any different so what was the problem and whose business was it anyway.</p><h2>Mayan Mythology (Mythology and Culture Worldwide)</h2><p>This new series is designed to help young readers understand the origins, cultural importance and impact of world mythologies; each title focuses on one cultural or national mythology and explains how those stories reflect the culture that created them.; This new volume in Lucent&#39;s Mythology and Culture Worldwide series looks at the mythology of the Mayan culture, and explains how the beliefs, values, and experiences of that culture are represented in its treasured stories.

While the focus of the book is on showing how the myths reflect the worldview and values of the Mayan civilization, the author has made an effort to prove they also reflect themes found in other religions and mythologies. The book&#x2019;s tone is scholarly and more suited to reports than the casual fan of myths and legends, particularly since the myths included are paraphrased rather than presented in full. Currie provides detailed notes for each chapter and an extensive list of further reading, weighted in favor of text sources over websites. Full-color photographs, explanatory sidebars, and a discussion of Mayan references in modern culture and literature contribute to the solid introduction.

Fire cracker plants grew around the wall, useful for starting fires in the mornings, and the crackers tasted good too. The connected orchard had pie trees of the most sinfully delicious varieties. The mistress of the household was exactly as beautiful, devoted, and accommodating as her husband desired. A man could hardly ask for a better situation.Except for one or two small things. "Where is your worser half?" Veleno muttered, looking apprehensively around."Don't worry," the Demoness Metria replied with a smile as her scant clothing shimmered into nothingness. "I sent Mentia off to see the Demon Grossclout about our other problem.""Other problem?"She pretended not to hear. "Grossclout's such an intractable cuss that it should take her days to pry any kind of an answer from him.""That's a relief!" he said, looking more than relieved. "It's not that I want to be critical, but--""But Mentia is slightly crazy," Metria finished. "And you married me, not my worser half. But because she did fission off from me, being disgusted by my new goody-goody attitude after I got half your soul, we can't keep her away. She's the half of me you naturally don't like--the soulless half, dedicated to making your life half-muled.""Half-whatted?""Horsed, equined, donkeyed, asinined--"He kissed her. "I think I could fathom the word if I concentrated. Let's make hay while the sun shines."She looked perplexed. "Hay? I thought you had something else in mind." A tantalizing wisp of strategically placed clothing appeared."I love it when you tease me," he said, picking her up and carrying her to the. master bedroom.She assumed the form of a nymph. "Eeeeek!" she cried faintly, kicking her marvelous bare legs in the nymphly way. "Whatever am I going to do?""You're going to make me deliriously happy, you luscious creature."She inhaled, enhancing what hardly needed it. "O, sigh, how can I escape this hideous fate?" she wailed cutely, kissing him on eye, ear, nose, and throat.They fell together on the bed, in a tangle of limbs, faces, kisses, and whatnot. "You are the best thing that ever happened to me," Veleno gasped around the activity."You're just the most wonderful, beautiful, lovable, exciting, fantastic person in all Xanth!""You damn me with faint praise," she muttered, clasping him with such ardor that description would be improper.Another demoness popped into the chamber. "Oh, there you are, Metria!" she exclaimed. "No wonder I couldn't findyou around the grounds. I have brought you what you most vitally need."Veleno stiffened, but not in the way he desired. "Oh, no!"Metria looked up from what was occupying her. "At the least opportune time, of course. Do you mind, worser half? I happen to be busy at the moment."Mentia peered closely. "Oh? Doing what?""Making my husband deliriously happy, of course, as only a demoness can.""When not being annoyingly interrupted," Veleno muttered.Mentia peered again. "Sorry. I thought that was a grimace of pain on what's-his-name's face. Are you sure you are doing an adequate job, better half?""Of course I'm sure!" Metria said indignantly. "He has not complained once in seven hundred and fifty times during the past year.""Oh? What about that groan he groaned just now?""That was when you appeared!""Well, if you feel that way, I'll just depart with what I brought, and never never return.""Oop, no!" Metria cried with alarm. "I need it!"Her husband, somewhat bemused by the interruption, put in two more words. "Need what?""Never mind," Metria said."It's a soldier matter.""A what matter?" he asked."Secluded, cloistered, isolated, remote, detached, obscure--""Private?""Whatever," she agreed crossly."But what could be private from your husband?" he asked somewhat querulously."Yes, whatever could you be suspiciously concealing from your trusting spouse?" Mentia echoed."Can't we have this discussion some other time?" Metria demanded, frustrated."Of course, dear," Mentia agreed. "I'll pop back in during the next century." She began to fuzz out."No, wait!" Metria cried. "Now will do after all.""Why, how nice," Mentia said, smiling with something more than good nature. "But don't you think you should introduce us first?""Whatever for? He knows who the mischief you are, from ever since you returned from that madness with the gargoyle.""Yes, but he may have forgotten. I've been away a whole hour, you know.""That long?" Veleno inquired with resignation.Metria gritted her teeth. There was nothing half so annoying as half a demoness! But she knew her worser half would not give over until she had her half-baked way. "Veleno, this is the Demoness Mentia, my soulless worser half, who represents what I was like before I got half-souled, except that she has no problem with vocational.""With what?""Idiom, language, speech, expression, locution, utterance, articulation--""Words?""Whatever. Instead, she's slightly crazy.""Yes, it's my talent," Mentia agreed proudly."And, Mentia, this is my husband Veleno, formerly a nymphomaniac, but he hasn't touched a nymph since I married him and took half his soul.""Yes, but hasn't he looked at nymphs out the window, with a glint in his--?""Pleased to meet you," Veleno gritted, drawing free a hand and extending it. "Now will you begone?""Charmed, I'm sure," Mentia said, forming a pair of pincers on the end of her arm."Ixnay," Metria murmured warningly. "Mortals are protected from harm in this castle.""Oh, that's right," Mentia agreed, disappointed. The pincers became an ordinary hand, which shook Veleno's hand. "That was one of the conditions of the restoration. Well,now that your mortal man and I have been properly introduced, I will give you what you most need, Metria."At last! But Metria still wasn't easy about this. "Veleno, dearest, why don't you take a little snooze for the moment?" Metria suggested dulcetly, covering his eyes with her hand."But what could you need that I have not provided?" he asked, frowning."Yes, I'm sure he will be really, truly interested in this very important secret matter," Mentia said, sitting on the edge of the bed, so that her thigh touched Veleno."Oh, all <i>right,"</i> Metria said, really crossly."Have no concern, dear, I will explain it excruciatingly clearly," Mentia said. "What I bring is information to help abate your incapacity, so you won't be a failure anymore.""What incapacity?" Veleno demanded. "My wife has made me deliriously happy almost continuously since we married.""That is the problem," Mentia said. "She has helped you with the chore of summoning the stork seven hundred and fifty--" she peered again "--and a half times this year, and more times during the prior year when I was too busy to be with her, unfortunately, and yet the stork has not gotten the message. She is clearly inadequate in this department."Veleno pondered, slowly realizing the truth of this statement. "That hadn't occurred to me," he said. "I was too delirious to think of the stork. But how could it fail to get the messages?""That is precisely what Metria wants to know," Mentia said. "Whatever could be wrong with her to bomb so badly in so many attempts? Whatever could make her such a sore loser? Especially when I could so readily have--""Nuh-uh!" Metria and Veleno said together."So she sent me to ask the most intelligent creature she knows, the Demon Grossclout, for advice," Mentia continued without concern, "and he instantly delegated me to convey that essential advice to her. Naturally I delayed not half a whit to honor that stricture. Her failing is simply too serious to permit any delay.""Thank you so much, Worser," Metria snarled."You are so welcome, Better. I knew you would want to attend to your washout without delay." Mentia's form fuzzed, and assumed the likeness of a giant lemon, then a cooked turkey. "I am thrilled to have been of so much help.""You haven't been of much help yet," Metria said grimly. "What did Grossclout <i>say</i>?""Oh, that. He says you should go ask Good Magician Humfrey.""But Humfrey charges a year's service for a single Answer!" Metria protested."I don't want to pay that! That's why I went to Grossclout.""Grossclout did add a few words," Mentia said. "I believe those words were <i>mush-head, cheapskate, and serve her right."</i>"That's Grossclout, all right," Metria agreed."He still holds a grudge just because I chose to sand my nails in his dull magic classes at Demon U.""Actually, that was I who did that," Mentia said, smiling reminiscently. "Back when we were inextricably bound together as alternate aspects of a single demoness. Those were the days! But I did not see fit to remind the Professor of that." She paused reflectively. "I might be able to remember a few more of his words, if it's really important," she offered helpfully."Thank you so much, no," Metria said."I think I have fathomed his altitude.""His what?""Manner, disposition, temperament, bent, inclination, penchant--""Attitude?" Veleno inquired."Whatever," Metria said crossly."From the height of his eminence," Mentia agreed. "Well, if you need no further assistance or advice on technique--""None!" Metria said."Too bad." Mentia faded out"You want the stork to deliver a baby?" Veleno inquired as Metria resumed activity."Yes. It's what married couples do. Raise children.""But demonesses don't get babies unless they want them.""Precisely. I want one." She looked away. "I suppose I should have told you, and I can't blame you for being angry.""But I'm not angry.""You aren't? But it might interrupt the delirium, and give you the solid obligation of raising a child.""Exactly! I want a family, now that it occurs to me."Metria gazed at him with adoration tinged substantially with relief. "Wonderful!"Now he was thoughtful. "The stork must figure that our signals aren't serious.""Which is ironic, considering how strong we have made them. I've just got to get the stork's distention!""The stork's what?""Observation, mindfulness, notice, focus, application--""Attention?""Whatever. What do you think I should do?"He considered. "I think you should go to ask the Good Magician.""But then I would have to leave you alone for a year.""Surely you could return on occasion. It might mean you could make me deliriously happy only three or four hundred times in that year, but I think I can survive that deprivation. After all, I want you to be happy too.""You dear wonderful man!" she exclaimed, and proceeded to do the impossible: to make him twice as delirious as before. But before she went, she checked around the premises, debating with herself, because her worser half had decided to unify for the occasion, now that there was a chance her lifewould become interesting again. 'Do I really want to do this?' Metria asked herself.'Why not? It isn't as if you have anything important to do around here.' Mentia had fissioned off in disgust when Metria married, got half a soul, and fell in love, in that order. Her worser half claimed to have been on a grand adventure with a gargoyle, and helped save all Xanth from madness, but that was surely an exaggeration. She had merged as soon as Metria stopped being nauseatingly nice to her husband.'If you had half a soul, you would have a different alti--attitude.''Praise the Demon X(A/N)th that I have not been corrupted with any portion of a soul,' Mentia agreed. Their dialogue was silent because it was internal; no one else could overhear it. She pointed with their left hand. 'There's a sand worm; step on it.''I will not,' Metria retorted. 'That wouldn't be nice.' She lifted the worm carefully with their right hand and inspected it. It was, of course, made of sand; if direct sunlight or water touched it, it would powder or dissolve away. So she put it back in a dry shaded section, and watched it wiggle off.'Disgusting,' Mentia remarked to no one else in particular. 'But you can redeem your demonly nature by squishing that June bug.''No way. Kill a June bug and the year loses its most romantic month.'Mentia grimaced with the left side of their face. 'I'd rather have you half-bottomed than half-souled.' She looked around, using Metria's left eye. 'I see that go-quat tree is fruiting.''So is the come-quat tree,' Metria agreed. 'Veleno likes them, when he's coming and going.''Which is he doing when he's alone with you?''The opposite of what he wants you to be doing.'But Mentia could not be shamed. 'Here is my favorite: the grapes with an attitude.''Sour grapes,' Metria agreed. 'Your kind.''So why are you dawdling around here, instead of getting moving to the Good Magician's castle?''I'm just not sure it's right to leave my husband on half rations.''There's all the food he needs, growing right around the castle here.''Half rations of delirium.''Oh.' Mentia looked around again, until the left eyeball was oriented completely to the side. 'Let's make it easy, then. See that winged nut tree?'The right eye swiveled. 'Of course. The nuts are almost as nutty as you are.''If the right wing nut flies first, we stay right here. If the left one flies first, we pop over to see the Good Magician.''That would be a crazy way to make such an important decision.''Precisely. Agreed?'Metria sighed. It was as good a way as any. 'Agreed.'They watched the two nuts quiver. The right one spread its wings. Then suddenly the left one lurched into the air and flew across to the nearby bolt tree. 'How romantic,' Mentia said, amused by what the boldest bolt did with the nut.'Why don't you find it romantic when Veleno and I--''Once is amusing. Seven hundred and fifty times is droll.''Not when you're in love.''I'm glad I'll never be in love. Let's be on our way.'Metria couldn't dawdle any longer, even if it did seem somewhat nutty or screwed up. The Good Magician's castle looked ordinary. Its wall and turrets were set within a sparkling circular moat, which in turn was inside a ring of mountains. Neither would be any problem for a demoness to pop across.But Metria was unable to pop across. When she tried, she bounced off an invisible barrier. 'Dam, I forgot!' she swore. 'The old fool has a shield against demonly intrusion.''That's what you consider swearing? That's not even worthy of the Juvenile Conspiracy.'Worse, she was unable to fly or dematerialize in this vicinity. Obviously the Good Magician had improved his defe...</p><h2>Daniel: God&#39;s Pattern for the Future</h2><p>Book by Swindoll, Charles R.</p><p></p><h2>Star of the Sea</h2><p>In the bitter winter of 1847, from an Ireland torn by famine and injustice, the <i>Star of the Sea</i> sets sail for New York. On board are hundreds of refugees, some optimistic, many more are desperate. Among them are a maid with a devastating secret, the bankrupt Lord Merridith and his wife and children, and a killer is stalking the decks, hungry for the vengeance that will bring absolution. <br> This journey will see many lives end, others begin anew. Passionate loves are tenderly recalled, shirked responsibilities regretted too late, and profound relationships are shockingly discovered. In this spellbinding tale of tragedy and mercy, love and healing, the farther the ship sails toward the Promised Land, the more her passengers seem moored to a past that will never let them go.<br> As urgently contemporary as it is historical, this gripping and compassionate novel builds with the pace of a thriller to a stunning conclusion.<br></p><p>Joseph O'Connor's impressive historical novel, <i>Star of the Sea</i>, examines the unsettled personal tragedies among a group of interrelated characters and their difficulties in disregarding the past. Lord Merridith and his family board the titular ship in 1847, bound for New York, leaving behind an Ireland devastated by famine and strife. The family's beautiful nanny, Mary Duane, is with them, having fled a life of poverty, prostitution, and extreme tragedy. Another passenger, American journalist Grantley Dixon, is lured to America by business and his thinly veiled affair with Lady Merridith. Mary Duane discovers that Pius Mulvey, her former fianc� and the brother of her deceased husband, is among the overcrowded group of disease-ridden steerage passengers. A renowned thief and murderer, Mulvey abandoned Duane, only to return and sabotage her life in Ireland. Despised by his countrymen, Mulvey has been ordered by a group of steerage thugs to assassinate the demonized Merridith or face his own death. <p> Conflict is inevitable, but O'Connor is more interested in the complexity of history and relationships and how each makes reinvention and resolution impossible. O'Connor presents the story as a work of journalism written by Dixon, composed in the era's tabloid style, even including passages from the captain's register and crew interviews. These devices lend the work a sense of authenticity, reinforced by the author's intimate knowledge of the period and his evocative, realistic prose: "At night one sensed the ship as absurdly out of its element, a creaking, leaking, incompetent concoction of oak and pitch and nails and faith, bobbing on a wilderness of viciously black water which could explode at the slightest provocation." O'Connor conveys a sense of immediacy and dimension in his ambitious story, providing this uncertain voyage with an ultimate sense of direction. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2003, 0-15-100908-2 <br></p><h2>Northern Chihuahuan Desert Wildflowers (Wildflower Series)</h2><p>Field guide to more than 260 wildflowers conveniently arranged for easy identification.

We have never had a president who gave rise to such widespread alarm about his lack of commitment to the institutions of self-government, to the norms democracy requires, and to the need for basic knowledge about how government works. We have never had a president who raises profound questions about his basic competence and his psychological capacity to take on the most challenging political office in the world.</p><p>Yet if Trump is both a threat to our democracy and a product of its weaknesses, the citizen activism he has inspired is the antidote. The reaction to the crisis created by Trump&#x2019;s presidency can provide the foundation for an era of democratic renewal and vindicate our long experiment in self-rule.</p><p>The award-winning authors of <i>One Nation After Trump</i> explain Trump&#x2019;s rise and the danger his administration poses to our free institutions. They also offer encouragement to the millions of Americans now experiencing a new sense of citizenship and engagement and argue that our nation needs a unifying alternative to Trump&#x2019;s dark and divisive brand of politics&#x2015;an alternative rooted in a New Economy, a New Patriotism, a New Civil Society, and a New Democracy. <i>One Nation After Trump</i> is the essential book for our era, an unsparing assessment of the perils facing the United States and an inspiring roadmap for how we can reclaim the future.</p></p><p>E.J.

First the take was spices and other exotic products of the Orient, then gold and ivory from Africa, followed by beaver pelts, coffee, and goods from the Americas, and finally luxurious sea otter pelts from the Northwest Coast of North America. The ships that made these voyages evolved over time and their navigators benefited from centuries of accumulated experience.<br><br><i>Voyages</i> recounts the extraordinary feats of more than twenty of Europe's most daring maritime explorers as they ventured into the unknown and braved uncharted territory, including Christopher Columbus, Bartolomeu Dias, Vasco da Gama, John Cabot, Giovanni da Verrazzano, Jacques Cartier, Martin Frobisher, Ferdinand Magellan, Francis Drake, and James Cook. Exquisitely illustrated with almost 100 of Gordon Miller's paintings, many detailed maps, and ship drawings, <i>Voyages</i> reveals the evolution of maritime technologies, the rise and fall of maritime empires, the extreme dangers of sailing uncharted waters, the courage and brutality of life at sea, and the discovery of new continents, cultures, and products. Through their voyages, these ships and sailors defined the true dimensions of the oceans and coastlines of the world.</p><p><b>Gordon Miller </b>is a distinguished maritime artist and illustrator living in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The key to Kintargo&#x2019;s defense lies in the lines of a single sprawling scroll recovered from the Church of Asmodeus&#x2015;the Kintargo Contract. Within this contract&#x2019;s rules and stipulations lie numerous loopholes and opportunities to use Cheliax&#x2019;s own love of law against them; to use the Kintargo Contract to secure not just the city, but the surrounding region&#x2019;s freedom from the infernal machinations of House Thrune and the Church of Asmodeus. Yet as the heroes set about securing these loopholes, an old menace from Kintargo&#x2019;s past seizes the opportunity to strike while the city still reels from its recent upheavals. Before Kintargo can be sheltered from Cheliax, the heroes must save her from a monster of her own making!<br> <br> &#x201c;The Kintargo Contract&#x201d; is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 13th-level characters. The adventure continues the Hell&#x2019;s Rebels Adventure Path, an urban- and political-themed campaign that focuses on a rebellion against one of the Pathfinder Campaign Setting&#x2019;s most infamous nations&#x2015;devil-haunted Cheliax.

A young, hip, business journalist in Boston, she discovered (in <i>The</i> <i>Family Trade</i> ) that her family comes from an alternate reality, that she is very well-connected, and that her family is a lot too much like the mafia for comfort. In addition, starting with the fact that women are family property and required to breed more family members with the unique talent to walk between worlds, she has tried to remain an outsider and her own woman. And start a profitable business in a third world she has discovered, outside the family reach (recounted in <i>The Hidden Family</i>). She fell in love with a distant relative but he's dead, killed saving her life. There have been murders, betrayals. Now, however, in <i>The Clan</i> <i>Corporate</i>, she may be overreaching. And if she gets caught, death or a fate worse is around the bend. There is for instance the brain-damaged son of the local king who needs a wife. But they'd never make her do that, would they?<br><br></p><p>CHARLES STROSS lives in Edinburgh, Scotland<br>Chapter One<br>Tied Down<br>&nbsp;<br>Nail lacquer, the woman called Helge reflected as she paused in the antechamber, always did two things to her: it reminded her of her mother, and it made her feel like a rebellious little girl. She examined the fingertips of her left hand, turning them this way and that in search of minute imperfections in the early afternoon sunlight slanting through the huge window behind her. There weren&#x2019;t any. The maidservant who had painted them for her had poor nails, cracked and brittle from hard work: her own, in contrast, were pearlescent and glossy, and about a quarter-inch longer than she was comfortable with. There seemed to be a lot of things that she was uncomfortable with these days. She sighed quietly and glanced at the door.<br>&nbsp;<br>The door opened at that moment. Was it coincidence, or was she being watched? Liveried footmen inclined their heads as another spoke. &#x201c;Milady, the duchess bids you enter. She is waiting in the day room.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Helge swept past them with a brief nod&#x2014;more acknowledgment of their presence than most of her rank would bother with&#x2014;and paused to glance back down the hallway as her servants (a lady-in-waiting, a court butler, and two hard-faced, impassive bodyguards) followed her. &#x201c;Wait in the hall,&#x201d; she told the guards. &#x201c;You can accompany me, but wait at the far end of the room,&#x201d; she told her attendant ing�nue. Lady Kara nodded meekly. She&#x2019;d been slow to learn that Helge bore an uncommon dislike for having her conversations eavesdropped on: there had been an unfortunate incident some weeks ago, and the lady-in-waiting had not yet recovered her self-esteem.<br>&nbsp;<br>The hall was perhaps sixty feet long and wide enough for a royal entourage. The walls, paneled in imported oak, were occupied by window bays interspersed with oil paintings and a few more-recent daguerreotypes of noble ancestors, the scoundrels and skeletons cluttering up the family tree. Uniformed servants waited beside each door. Helge paced across the rough marble tiles, her spine rigid and her shoulders set defensively. At the end of the hall an equerry wearing the polished half-armor and crimson breeches of his calling bowed, then pulled the tasseled bell-pull beside the double doors. &#x201c;The Countess Helge voh Thorold d&#x2019;Hjorth!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The doors opened, ushering Countess Helge inside, leaving servants and guards to cool their heels at the threshold.<br>&nbsp;<br>The day room was built to classical proportions&#x2014;but built large, in every dimension. Four windows, each twelve feet high, dominated the south wall, overlooking the regimented lushness of the gardens that surrounded the palace. The ornate plasterwork of the ceiling must have occupied a master and his journeymen for a year. The scale of the architecture dwarfed the merely human furniture, so that the chaise longue the duchess reclined on, and the spindly rococo chair beside it, seemed like the discarded toy furniture of a baby giantess. The duchess herself looked improbably fragile: gray hair growing out in intricately coiffed coils, face powdered to the complexion of a china doll, her body lost in a court gown of black lace over burgundy velvet. But her eyes were bright and alert&#x2014;and knowing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Helge paused before the duchess. With a little moue of concentration she essayed a curtsey. &#x201c;Your grace, I are&#x2014;am&#x2014;happy to see you,&#x201d; she said haltingly in hochsprache. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I&#x2014;oh damn.&#x201d; The latter words slipped out in her native tongue. She straightened her knees and sighed. &#x201c;Well? How am I doing?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; The duchess examined her minutely from head to foot, then nodded slightly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting better. Well enough to pass tonight. Have a seat.&#x201d; She gestured at the chair beside her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Miriam sat down. &#x201c;As long as nobody asks me to dance,&#x201d; she said ruefully. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got two left feet, it seems.&#x201d; She plucked at her lap. &#x201c;And as long as I don&#x2019;t end up being cornered by a drunken backwoods peer who thinks not being fluent in his language is a sign of an imbecile. And as long as I don&#x2019;t accidentally mistake some long-lost third cousin seven times removed for the hat-check clerk and resurrect a two-hundred-year-old blood feud. And as long as&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Dear,&#x201d; the duchess said quietly, &#x201c;do please shut up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The countess, who had grown up as Miriam but whom everyone around her but the duchess habitually called Helge, stopped in mid-flow. &#x201c;Yes, Mother,&#x201d; she said meekly. Folding her hands in her lap she breathed out. Then she raised one eyebrow.<br>&nbsp;<br>The duchess looked at her for almost a minute, then nodded minutely. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll pass,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;With the jewelry, of course. And the posh frock. As long as you don&#x2019;t let your mouth run away with you.&#x201d; Her cheek twitched. &#x201c;As long as you remember to be Helge, not Miriam.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I feel like I&#x2019;m acting all the time!&#x201d; Miriam protested.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of course you do.&#x201d; The duchess finally smiled. &#x201c;Imposter syndrome goes with the territory.&#x201d; The smile faded. &#x201c;And I didn&#x2019;t do you any favors in the long run by hiding you from all this.&#x201d; She gestured around the room. &#x201c;It becomes harder to adapt, the older you get.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Miriam frowned momentarily. &#x201c;I can deal with disguises and a new name and background; I can even cope with trying to learn a new language, it&#x2019;s the sense of permanence that&#x2019;s disconcerting. I grew up an only child, but Helge has all these&#x2014;relatives&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t grow up with, and they&#x2019;re real. That&#x2019;s hard to cope with. And you&#x2019;re here, and part of it!&#x201d; Her frown returned. &#x201c;And now this evening&#x2019;s junket. If I thought I could avoid it, I&#x2019;d be in my rooms having a stomach cramp all afternoon.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That would be a Bad Idea.&#x201d; The duchess still had the habit of capitalizing her speech when she was waxing sarcastic, Miriam noted.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I know that. I&#x2019;m just&#x2014;there are things I should be doing that are more important than attending a royal garden party. It&#x2019;s all deeply tedious.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;With an attitude like that you&#x2019;ll go far.&#x201d; Her mother paused. &#x201c;All the way to the scaffold if you don&#x2019;t watch your lip, at least in public. Do I need to explain how sensitive to social niceties your position here is? This is not America&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, well, more&#x2019;s the pity.&#x201d; Miriam shrugged minutely.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re stuck with the way things are,&#x201d; the duchess said sharply, then subsided slightly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, dear, I don&#x2019;t mean to snap. I&#x2019;m just worried for you. The sooner you learn how to mind yourself without mortally offending anyone by accident the happier I&#x2019;ll be.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Um.&#x201d; Miriam chewed on the idea for a while. She&#x2019;s stressed, she decided. Is that all it is, or is there something more? &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll try. But I came here to see how you are, not to have a moan on your shoulder. So, how are you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, now that you ask . . .&#x201d; Her mother smiled and waved vaguely at a table behind her chaise longue. Miriam followed her gesture: two aluminium crutches, starkly functional, lay atop a cloisonn� stand next to a pill case. &#x201c;The doctor says I&#x2019;m to reduce the prednisone again next week. The Copaxone seems to be helping a lot, and that&#x2019;s just one injection a day. As long as nobody accidentally forgets to bring me next week&#x2019;s prescription I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But surely nobody would&#x2014;&#x201d; Miriam&#x2019;s whole body quivered with anger.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; The duchess glanced back at her daughter, her expression unreadable. &#x201c;You seem to have forgotten what kind of a place this is. The meds aren&#x2019;t simply costly in dollars and cents: someone has to bring them across from the other world. And courier time is priceless. Nobody gives me a neatly itemized bill, but if I want to keep on receiving them I have to pay. And the first rule of business around here is, Don&#x2019;t piss off the blackmailers.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Miriam&#x2019;s reluctant nod seemed to satisfy the duchess, because she nodded: &#x201c;Remember, a lady never unintentionally gives offense&#x2014;especially to people she depends on to keep her alive. If you can hang on to just one rule to help you survive in the Clan, make it that one. But I&#x2019;m losing the plot. How are you doing? Have there been any aftereffects?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Aftereffects?&#x201d; Miriam caught her hand at her chin and forced herself to stop fidgeting. She flushed, pulse jerking with an adrenaline surge of remembered fear and anger. &#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d; She lowered her hand. &#x201c;Oh, nothing physical,&#x201d; she said bitterly. &#x201c;Nothing . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking about him a lot lately, Miriam. He wouldn&#x2019;t have been good for you, you know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; The younger woman&#x2014;youth being relative: she wouldn&#x2019;t be seeing thirty again&#x2014;dropped her gaze. &#x201c;The political entanglements made it a messy prospect at best,&#x201d; she said, frowning. &#x201c;Even if you discounted his weaknesses.&#x201d; The duchess didn&#x2019;t reply. Eventually Miriam looked up, her eyes burning with emotions she&#x2019;d experienced only since learning to be Helge. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t forgiven him, you know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Forgiven Roland?&#x201d; The duchess&#x2019;s tone sharpened.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No. Your goddamn half-brother. He&#x2019;s meant to be in charge of security! But he&#x2014;&#x201d; Her voice began to break.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, I know. And do you think he has been sleeping well lately? I&#x2019;m led to believe he&#x2019;s frantically busy right now. Losing Roland was the least of our problems, if you&#x2019;ll permit me to be blunt, and Angbard has a major crisis to deal with. Your affair with him can be ignored, if it comes to it, by the Council. It&#x2019;s not as if you&#x2019;re a teenage virgin to be despoiled, damaging some aristocratic alliance by losing your honor&#x2014;and you&#x2019;d better think about that some more in future, because honor is the currency in the circles you move in, a currency that once spent is very hard to regain&#x2014;but the deeper damage to the Clan that Matthias inflicted&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Tell me about it,&#x201d; Miriam said bitterly. &#x201c;As soon as I was back on my feet they told me I could only run courier assignments to and from a safe house. And I&#x2019;m not allowed to go home!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Matthias knows you,&#x201d; her mother pointed out. &#x201c;If he mentioned you to his new employers&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I understand.&#x201d; Miriam subsided in a sullen silence, arms crossed before her and back set defensively. After a moment she started tapping her toes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Stop that!&#x201d; Moderating her tone, the duchess added, &#x201c;If you do that in public it sends entirely the wrong message. Appearances are everything, you&#x2019;ve got to learn that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Mother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>After a couple of minutes, the duchess spoke. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not happy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And it&#x2019;s not just&#x2014;him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Correct.&#x201d; Her hem twitched once more before Helge managed to control the urge to tap.<br>&nbsp;<br>The duchess sighed. &#x201c;Do I have to drag it out of you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, Iris.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t call me that here. Bad habits of thought and behavior, you know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Bad? Or just inappropriate? Liable to send the wrong message?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The duchess chuckled. &#x201c;I should know better than to argue with you, dear!&#x201d; She looked serious. &#x201c;The wrong message in a nutshell. Miriam can&#x2019;t go home, Helge. Not now, maybe not ever. Thanks to that scum-sucking rat-bastard defector the entire Clan network in Massachusetts is blown wide open and if you even think about going&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, I know, there&#x2019;ll be an FBI SWAT team staking out my backyard and I&#x2019;ll vanish into a supermax prison so fast my feet don&#x2019;t touch the ground. If I&#x2019;m lucky,&#x201d; she added bitterly. &#x201c;So everything&#x2019;s locked down like a code-red terrorist alert; the only way I&#x2019;m allowed to go back to our world is on a closely supervised courier run to an underground railway station buried so deep I don&#x2019;t even see daylight; if I want anything&#x2014;even a box of tampons&#x2014;I have to requisition it and someone in the Security Directorate has to fill out a risk assessment to see if it&#x2019;s safe to obtain; and, and . . .&#x201d; Her shoulders heaved with indignation.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This is what it was like the whole time, during the civil war,&#x201d; the duchess pointed out.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So people keep telling me, as if I&#x2019;m supposed to be grateful! But it&#x2019;s not as if this is my only option. I&#x2019;ve got another identity over in world three and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Do they have tampons there?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Helge paused for a moment. &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; she said slowly. &#x201c;But they&#x2019;ve got cotton wool.&#x201d; She fumbled for a moment, then pulled out a pen-sized voice recorder. &#x201c;Memo: business plans. Investigate early patent filings covering tampons and applicators. Also sterilization methods&#x2014;dry heat?&#x201d; She clicked the recorder off and replaced it. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; A lightning smile that was purely Miriam flashed across her face and was gone. &#x201c;I should be over there,&#x201d; she added earnestly. &#x201c;World three is my project. I set up the company and I ought to be managing it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Firstly, our dear long-lost relatives are over there,&#x201d; the duchess pointed out. &#x201c;Truce or not, if they haven&#x2019;t got the message yet, you could show your nose over there and get it chopped off. And secondly . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ah, yes. Secondly.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You know what I&#x2019;m going to say,&#x201d; the duchess said quietly. &#x201c;So please don&#x2019;t shoot the messenger.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Helge turned her head to stare moodily out of the nearest window. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to tell me that the political situation is messy. That if I go over there right now some of the more jumpy first citizens of the Clan will get the idea that I&#x2019;m abandoning the sinking ship, aided and abetted by my delightful grandmother&#x2019;s whispering campaign&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Leave the rudeness to me. She&#x2019;s my cross to bear.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but.&#x201d; Helge stopped.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her mother took a deep breath. &#x201c;The Clan, for all its failings, is a very democratic organization. Democratic in the original sense of the word. If enough of the elite voters agree, they can depose the leadership, indict a member of the Clan for trial by a jury of their peers&#x2014;anything. Which is why appearances, manners, and social standing are so important. Hypocrisy is the grease that lubricates the Clan&#x2019;s machinery.&#x201d; Her cheek twitched. &#x201c;Oh yes. While I remember, love, if you are accused of anything never, ever, insist on your right to a trial by jury. Over here, that word does not mean what you think it means. Like the word secretary. Pah, but I&#x2019;m woolgathering! Anyway. My mother, your grandmother, has a constituency, Miri&#x2014;Helge. Tarnation. Swear at me if I slip again, will you, dear? We need to break each other of this habit.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Helge nodded. &#x201c;Yes, Iris.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The duchess reached over and swatted her lightly on the arm. &#x201c;Patricia! Say my full name.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Helge met her gaze. &#x201c;All right. Your grace is the honorable Duchess Patricia voh Hjorth d&#x2019;Wu ab Thorold.&#x201d; With mild rebellion: &#x201c;Also known as Iris Beckstein, of 34 Coffin Street&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough!&#x201d; Her mother nodded sharply. &#x201c;Put the rest behind you for the time being. Until&#x2014;unless&#x2014;we can ever go back, the memories can do nothing but hurt you. You&#x2019;ve got to live in the present. And the present means living among the Clan and deporting yourself as a, a countess. Because if you don&#x2019;t do that, all the alternatives on offer are drastically worse. This isn&#x2019;t a rich world, like America. Most women only have one thing to trade: as a lady of the Clan you&#x2019;re lucky enough to have two, even th...</p><h2>Great disasters</h2><p>A comprehensive, historical overview of some of the world&#39;s greatest natural disasters captures the power of the human spirit as it triumphs over the floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other calamities</p><p>This illustrated survey of calamities takes in the Ice Age, Europe's Black Death epidemic of the 14th century, the Chicago fire of 1871, "pea souper" fogs in London from the 17th to the 19th centuries, and current droughts, crop losses and famines in Africa. Such range in the detailing of facts and lore of fantastical misfortunes will reward the curious reader. Cliches abound, however, limiting the power of the prose: modern Africa's "starving throngs" are said to "haunt the world's imagination"; after Japan's Kanto earthquake of 1923, rumors of the scope of its destruction "spread like wildfire" and "terror stalked the streets." Many of the 350 photographs and paintings hold the attention more surely, among them a Viennese print depicting a woman dressed to ward off cholera in the 19th century and a photograph of houses tossed, turned and shredded during the Johnstown Flood of 1889 in Pennsylvania. 30,000 first printing; $30,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Coins of the Indian Sultanates: Covering the Area of Present-Day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh</h2><p>The coinage of the Indian Sultanates is a very important primary source for helping us understand the political and economic history of much of what is now India, Pakistan and Bangladesh from the beginning of the thirteenth century AD until the seventeenth century when the last of the sultanates was absorbed into the Mughal empire.

I think that Mog the Forgetful Cat maybe be one of the first children&#39;s books to employ the &#34;annoying pet saves the day just before being given the boot&#34; story lines that are so popular now (Walter the Farting Dog, anyone?) In her first book, Mog is locked out again because she has forgotten about the cat door, despite the fact that that is the very door through which she left the house. Anxious to get back in the house, Mog jumps up in the flower box (smashing the geraniums again) and startles a burglar in the middle of stealing the silver.</p><p>Mog is a cat, and she lives with a family named Thomas. Mog is a nice cat--but very forgetful. She forgets she has a cat door, and she forgets she&#39;s already eaten her supper. But one night, Mog&#39;s forgetfulness comes in very handy. Here is the very first Mog story, now in a handsome anniversary edition. Ages 4-7Judith Kerr was born in Berlin, but left Germany with her family in 1933 to escape the Nazis. They arrived in England in 1936, having spent the intervening years in Switzerland and France. There she met her husband Nigel Kneale and they had two children together; Judith wrote her first picture `The Tiger Who Came to Tea&#39; for them, which has gone on to become a much-loved classic, as well as many other titles including the timeless `Mog the Forgetful Cat&#39;.

Buy for demand. Yin-Fei Lo's authoritative book is both more sophisticated and more ambitious than Yan's. Real Cantonese cooking is characterized by lightness and freshnessnot by the cornstarch-y sauces of most American Cantonese restaurants. The author includes both authentic classics and her own interpretations of Cantonese cuisine, with precise instructions for each recipe, wine and menu suggestions, and a guide to the Cantonese kitchen.

But hidden within the rituals of its creation is a fascinating and mysterious story - a story of two remarkable men whose strange twenty-year relationship lies at the core of this historic undertaking.</p><p>When the editors of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> put out a call during the late 19th century pleading for "men of letters" to provide help with their mammoth undertaking, hundreds of responses came forth. Some helpers, like Dr. W.C. Minor, provided literally thousands of entries to the editors. But Minor, an American expatriate in England and a Civil War veteran, was actually a certified lunatic who turned in his dictionary entries from the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Simon Winchester has produced a mesmerizing coda to the deeply troubled Minor's life, a life that in one sense began with the senseless murder of an innocent British brewery worker that the deluded Minor believed was an assassin sent by one of his numerous "enemies." <p> Winchester also paints a rich portrait of the OED's leading light, Professor James Murray, who spent more than 40 years of his life on a project he would not see completed in his lifetime. Winchester traces the origins of the drive to create a "Big Dictionary" down through Murray and far back into the past; the result is a fascinating compact history of the English language (albeit admittedly more interesting to linguistics enthusiasts than historians or true crime buffs). That Murray and Minor, whose lives took such wildly disparate turns yet were united in their fierce love of language, were able to view one another as peers and foster a warm friendship is just one of the delicately turned subplots of this compelling book. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p><p>Limited Edition</p><p>&#x201c;I am the Governor of the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum.

(Just kidding, I know you know): Interviews from The Poetry Project Newsletter (1983 - 2009)</h2><p><p>The Poetry Project at St. Mark&#x2019;s Church was founded in 1966 for the overlapping circles of poets in the Lower East Side of New York. These interviews from <i>The Poetry Project Newsletter </i>form a kind of conversation over time between some of the late 20th century's most influential poets and artists, who have come together in this legendary venue over the past 50 years. Includes interviews with Charles North, Anne Waldman, Bernadette Mayer, David Rattray, Allen Ginsberg, Kenneth Koch, Harryette Mullen, Barbara Henning, David Henderson, Lisa Jarnot, Alice Notley, Ed Sanders, Samuel Delany, Harry Matthews, Victor Hernandez Cruz, Renee Gladman, Lorenzo Thomas, Fred Moten, Stan Brakhage, Alex Katz, Lewis Warsh, Ron Padgett, Maggie Nelson, Wayne Koestenbaum, Eileen Myles, and more.</p><p>"I find it one of the liveliest points of communication in the American poetry world. There is an incredible excitement to come to the church and read one's poems to the many other poets who congregate there, drawn to the church by its own energy and thrust." Donald Hall</p><p>From the introduction, by Anselm Berrigan:</p><p><i>For the poets closely involved with the Poetry Project since, and subsequent to, its inception, the interviews were an opportunity to speak directly to a community one could perceive as known, imaginary, expanding, unwieldy, intermittent, formative, desperately necessary, and sometimes peculiarly unsatisfying all at once. Community being the kind of term that often implies everything and nothing simultaneously, with the bottom falling out of the word depending on who happens to be wielding it. Poets can be particularly adept at using and exposing such terms.</i></p></p><p>Anselm Berrigan is the author of seven books of poetry: <i>Come In Alone</i> (Wave Books, 2016), <i>Primitive State</i> (Edge, 2015), <i>Notes from Irrelevance</i> (Wave Books, 2011), <i>Free Cell</i> (City Lights Books, 2009), <i>Some Notes on My Programming</i> (Edge, 2006), <i>Zero Star Hotel</i> (Edge, 2002), and <i>Integrity and Dramatic Life</i> (Edge, 1999). He is also co-author of two collaborative books: <i>Loading</i>, with visual artist Jonathan Allen (Brooklyn Arts Press, 2013), and <i>Skasers</i>, with poet John Coletti (Flowers &amp; Cream, 2012).

Commonplace animals are twisted together in impossible combinations, and human bodies are merged with animal forms in ways that are often both comic and ghastly. Images of these monstrosities pervade art and culture in the Middle Ages, and for medieval pages they must have been a tantalizing suggestion of unknown worlds and unthinkable dangers. But what were they doing there? Were they meaningless distractions, or did these strange beasts have other symbolic meanings? Alixe Bovey&#39;s readable text explains the meaning of these monsters and their place in medieval art.</p><p><b>Alixe Bovey</b> is Curator for the Survey of Illuminated Manuscripts at the British Library.<p></p></p><h2>Sexual Authenticity: An Intimate Reflection on Homosexuality and Catholicism</h2><p>Real glimpses into the hearts and lives of other people are rare...<br><br>Columnist and author Melinda Selmys gives readers an unusual opportunity to explore the topic of homosexuality and the Catholic Faith from a fresh, sincere perspective. Her intensely personal reflections help clarify the misconceptions that have hindered meaningful dialogue between Catholics and homosexuals. Transcending stereotypes and avoiding pat sentiments, she speaks directly to every Christian who has experienced same-sex attraction or knows someone who has. <br><br>In addition to her personal story of exchanging secular lesbianism for Catholicism and resolving her own inner conflicts, the author presents an enlightening analysis of history, social theory, and media influence on the subject of homosexuality. She refutes much of the clumsy theorizing and junk science common from both sides of the debate, effectively bridging many gaps between perceptions and reality. Selmys addresses the complexities surrounding sexual identity with pronounced compassion, adding a practical discussion of the Theology of the Body to complete the circle from a Catholic perspective. <br><br>Her ground-breaking book expertly walks the fine line between divisiveness and platitudes. A must read for everyone who has ever felt ambiguous about the Church's stance on homosexuality or those who have longed to see the fall of anti-gay iconoclasm that has compromised Christianity.</p><p>Melinda Selmys is a contributor and columnist for several periodicals. She is a wife and mother and very active in numerous Catholic organizations.</p><h2>The Farther Reaches of Human Nature (An Esalen Book)</h2><p>Abraham H. Maslow was one of the foremost spokespersons of humanistic psychology. In The Farthest Reaches of Human Nature, an extension of his classic... Toward a Psychology of Being, Maslow explores the complexities of human nature by using both the empirical methods of science and the aesthetics of philosophical inquiry. With essays on biology, synergy, creativity, cognition, self-actualization, and the hierarchy of needs, this posthumous work is a wide-ranging synthesis of Maslow&#39;s inspiring and influential ideas.</p><p><b>Abraham H. Maslow</b> taught at Brooklyn College and the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute, and was Chairman of the Department of Psychology at Brandeis University. From 1967 to 1968 he was Preseident of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Maslow was one of the foremost spokesmen of the humanistic, or "Third Force," psychologies, and author of many books and articles, including <b>Toward a Psychology of Being</b>, <b>The Psychology of Science</b>, and <b>Religions, Values, and Peak-Experiences</b>.</p><h2>The Road to Delphi: The Life and Afterlife of Oracles</h2><p><p>Cultures of all epochs have consulted oracles in times of need. This fascinating exploration of the enduring popularity of oracles examines how they are interpreted and why. Taking examples from literature and history, from the oracles at Delphi to those in <i>Macbeth</i>, and further still to the works of Kafka and Bob Dylan, and even in the film <i>The Matrix</i>, Wood combines storytelling and commentary to provide a lively account of humanity's persistent faith in signs, which continues to exert an important influence on the course of civilization.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Wood </b>is Charles Barnwell Straut Professor of English at Princeton University. He is the author of three previous books, most recently<i> The Magician's Doubts</i>, an acclaimed analysis of Nabokov's works. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>The oracular tradition is an immensely rich and provocative subject, and literary critic Wood's wide-ranging and penetrating scrutiny is cogently philosophical, keenly aesthetic, and gratifyingly entertaining. The allure of oracle stories resides in the fact that ambiguity and skepticism are intrinsic to the proceedings: the pronouncements of oracles tend to take the form of unsolvable riddles and puns. As Wood ponders the perverse inscrutability of prophecies, he wonders if fate is escapable, muses over "our need for stories of equivocation," and places "the labor of interpretation" high among humankind's most persistent habits of being. The story of Oedipus is Wood's touchstone, and he adeptly parses an array of interpretations from the classics to the work of Stravinsky. He traces the fate of oracles after Christ, analyzes the role of oracles in Shakespeare and Kafka, then delves into such lesser yet nonetheless effective vehicles as <i>The Matrix</i>. What emerges most poignantly from Wood's imaginative and learned inquiry is a renewed appreciation of our species' creativity and contrariness, and the universal and timeless power of stories. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Where the Celtic chieftains of Britain battle to save their land from an onrushing darkness. . . . In this modern classic, Stephen Lawhead presents a majestic retelling of Western literature&#39;s most compelling epic. The Sword of Britain. While many strove to claim it, one hand alone could remove the blade of Kingship from its stone sheath. He came -- a raw youth among ambitious lords too blind to recognize their king. He came -- to a Britain divided, ripe for conquest by barbarian hordes. The songs of Taliesin the master bard had foretold his rising. The vision of Merlin the prophet would guide him. He was Arthur, Pendragon of the Isle of the Mighty. His courage would be lauded; his enemies, legion; his reign, legendary. Under Arthur, by wisdom as much as might, Britain would unite. Through Arthur would arise a kingdom of peace, prosperity, and righteousness -- the long-awaited Kingdom of Summer. Yet, in the midst of flourishing virtue, an evil would arise to challenge Britain&#39;s most brilliant Crown. . . . Arthur is book three in the Pendragon Cycle.

It's not because she's black&#x2015;most of the other students in the fourth-grade class at her West Philadelphia elementary school are too. Maybe it's because she celebrates Kwanzaa, or because she's forbidden from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Maybe it's because she calls her father&#x2015;a housepainter-slash-philosopher&#x2015;"Baba" instead of "Daddy," or because her parents' friends gather to pour out libations "from the Creator, for the Martyrs" and discuss "the community."<br> Kenya does know that it's connected to what her Baba calls "the shame of being alive"&#x2015;a shame that only grows deeper and more complex over the course of Asali Solomon's long-awaited debut novel. <i>Disgruntled</i>, effortlessly funny and achingly poignant, follows Kenya from West Philadelphia to the suburbs, from public school to private, from childhood through adolescence, as she grows increasingly disgruntled by her inability to find any place or thing or person that feels like home.<br> A coming-of-age tale, a portrait of Philadelphia in the late eighties and early nineties, an examination of the impossible double-binds of race, <i>Disgruntled</i> is a novel about the desire to rise above the limitations of the narratives we're given and the painful struggle to craft fresh ones we can call our own.</p></p><p><b>Asali Solomon</b> received a Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers' Award for the stories later collected in <i>Get Down</i>, her first book; the volume was also a finalist for the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award. In 2007 she was named one of the National Book Foundation's 5 Under 35. Solomon teaches English at Haverford College. She lives in Philadelphia with her husband and two sons.<p>One of <i>The Denver Post</i>'s "Best Fiction Books of 2015"</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Disgruntled </i>is . . . a smart, philosophical, coming-of-age tale featuring a vivid protagonist who battles 'the shame of being alive.' . . .

It's when you don't know things. What things? The things you learn in childhood. This paradox is the heartbeat of Asali Solomon's moving, tough-minded novel, which talks about all of it: family ties, highs and lows, pop culture, work, race, love, and all the other things that make up life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson</i></p><p>&#x201c;Kenya Curtis' coming-of-age story is fraught and touching and painful and very, very human. But Solomon's exploration of how the political fits into the personal - as well as her insightful handling of black nationalist thought - is what elevates the story to something that is not only compelling as a narrative, but intellectually compelling, too. It's a novel that should not be missed.&#x201d; &#x2015;Emma Cueto, <i>Bustle</i></p><p>&#x201c;An air of dissatisfaction pervades this unsentimental portrait of one girl's rocky journey to adulthood, in an impressive debut novel from Solomon . . . The perpetual outsider, Kenya searches for her places in society as she bounces between schools, friend groups, and family members.

This is a bildingsroman with a kick.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Disgruntled</i> Solomon has created a masterful young woman's coming-of-age story as Kenya struggles to create herself in spite of the numerous forces that would constrict her.&#x201d; &#x2015;Thomas Chatterton Williams, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>&#x201c;Preternaturally observant and mordantly funny, Kenya is a hypnotic narrator coping valiantly with an increasingly bewildering life . . . navigating the chill of a private, primarily white high school and dreaming of college. Solomon's cultural references resound, her dialogue stings, and the intricate and surprising relationships she choreographs are saturated with racial, sexual, and political quandaries of intimate and epochal repercussions . . . Deft, knowing, bold, and witty.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Donna Seaman, Booklist (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;A standout.&#x201d; &#x2015;Rebecca Carroll, <i>The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this witty take on 1980s Philadelphia, a young girl comes of age and learns to navigate love, loss, school and family. Kenya, whom we meet at age 7 and watch graduate from high school into womanhood, is the daughter of Afrocentric parents. Their politics and yearly celebration of Kwanzaa, which entails &#x2018;sporting an orange, yellow and brown dashiki and a forehead-straining vertical braided hairstyle,' make Kenya a social pariah even at her all-black school. In Kenya, Solomon has crafted a character of irrepressible verve and voice who carries us joyously through the novel--even after she witnesses her parents' breakup, when her father is imprisoned for injuring her mother with a gun. With the separation, Kenya is propelled from her safe black Philly world into the white world of an elite private school--the very world her father fled, traumatized and bitter. Here, she becomes a master of code-switching to fit in, all while knowing that her classmates will never truly accept her. After a chance meeting with a black boy from her old neighborhood turns into a failed love affair, Kenya seeks comfort in a visit to her father, newly released from prison. The scenes with Kenya's father, who's enjoying a bigamous life with two new wives and two new sets of kids, are razor-sharp on the contradictions of identity--here, for example, we see Kenya's father, a staunch activist for African-American rights unable to make the link to respect women's rights. Kenya has a palpable need for her father to become a solid, guiding force as she steps into womanhood, but he can't do it. And when her stepfather loses all her mother's money, Kenya's future college education doesn't quite go as planned. In this debut novel, Solomon (<i>Get Down</i>, 2008) examines the confusing moments on the verge of adulthood within the ever shifting makeup of family and society. Blackness, feminism and the loss of virginity have never been analyzed by a more astute and witty main character.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;One of my favorite story collections. Asali Solomon's <i>Get Down</i> is a book that understands the degree to which race and racial identity are so often about performance . . . Race is one thematic link of the collection, and it is given its due complexity. But the thread that ultimately ties these stories together, and these characters to readers, is the raw desire for genuine human connection in the face of everything--race included--that seems determined to sabotage it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Danielle Evans, NPR on Get Down</i></p><p>&#x201c;Fresh, intimate portraits of people trying to straddle contradictory worlds.

The woman with auburn hair, perfect posture, and a broken life picked it up.<br><br>"I can't read this," she said, and lifted her head.<br><br>"That's because it's in Latin," I said. "Why don't you take off the sunglasses?"<br><br>"Why don't you translate for me?"<br><br>"Take off the glasses."<br><br>The woman slid the dark frames up and off her face. Her left eye was brown and watering. Her right was black and swollen shut. The cheekbone below it offered a study in shades of purple, blue, and yellow.<br><br>"You get the picture?" she said.<br><br>"The poem is by Catullus. First line reads <i>Odi et amo</i>. Translates as <i>I hate and I love.</i>"<br><br>"And this is my life?"<br><br>"People say it's a love poem, but they're wrong. It's about abuse, about not being able to get out, even when the door is wide open and the whole world is yelling that very thing in your ear."<br><br>"I can't just leave. It's not that simple."<br><br>"It never is. Let me ask you something. How do you think this ends?"<br><br>The woman dropped her eyes back to her lap.<br><br>"You're a smart woman, Janet. You can figure it out. You wind up hurt real bad. Maybe dead. Or . . ."<br><br>She raised her head again. "Or what?"<br><br>"Or he winds up dead. Either way, it's not good."<br><br>She thinned her lips and set a hard edge at the corners of her mouth. There'd never been anything soft about Janet Woods' face. Beautiful, yes. Even through the bruises. But never soft.<br><br>"What do you want?" she said.<br><br>"Same thing I wanted three months ago. Get you out of there. Today. Taylor's in school, right?"<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>"Okay. We pick her up. I take you to a safe place. No one knows but me, you, and your little girl. Then I approach your husband. Explain the situation to him."<br><br>"Johnny will never go for it."<br><br>"He doesn't decide, Janet. He just listens."<br><br>She hesitated, then shook her head. "I can't. Not right now."<br><br>I leaned back in my chair and looked toward the front windows. The sun had cracked through my blinds, and dust floated in panels of afternoon light.<br><br>"Don't make this personal, Michael."<br><br>I swept my gaze back across the room. "Excuse me?"<br><br>Janet had brought a cup of Starbucks with her. She took a final sip and dropped the cup into a wastebasket near her feet. Then she crossed her legs and deflated a little with a sigh.<br><br>"I said, 'Don't make this personal.'"<br><br>"What does that mean?"<br><br>She shrugged and stared at the line of her calf, the angle of her shoe.<br><br>"I don't know. Just don't."<br><br>I breathed lightly through my nose and let the silence between us settle. Old friends make lousy clients. When that friend was once something more, things only get worse. I considered the tangle of history that bound us to each other, but got nowhere with it.<br><br>Then I sat forward, tented my fingers on the surface of my desk, and smiled. "How about some lunch?"<br><br>Janet closed the book I'd given her and dropped the glasses back over her face. "Sounds good."<br><br>"Let's go," I said. "There's a new place down the street."<br><br>She unfolded slowly from her chair, moving stiffly for a woman in her thirties. I figured Johnny Woods might be doing a little bodywork as well but didn't comment.<br><br>We made our way out of my office and down the corridor. I stopped about halfway down. My client stopped with me. She kept her eyes fastened on her feet as she spoke. "What?"<br><br>"Let me at least approach him. Just once. I can run into him by accident."<br><br>"What good will that do?"<br><br>"Maybe I can get to know him. Talk some sense into him."<br><br>Janet put a hand to her temple and rubbed. Her fingers were long and thin. Old, but not with age. Then she dropped her hand back to her side and gave a small shrug.<br><br>"He can't know I've hired a private investigator."<br><br>"I understand."<br><br>She nodded once and we started down the corridor again. It wasn't everything I wanted. In fact, it wasn't even close. But at least it was a start.<br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>I double-parked on Michigan Avenue, popped my blinkers, and cruised the FM dial. I was tapping along to a-ha singing "Take on Me" and wondering whatever happened to my inner Led Zeppelin when Fred Jacobs walked out of the Tribune Building.<br><br>Fred was six feet two and weighed slightly less than your average house cat. He was chasing sixty, with an Adam's apple that earned every bit of its moniker and a head of black hair the color and consistency of shoe leather. He wore a brown Ban-Lon golf shirt over a pair of green-and-gold-checked polyester pants with inch-and-a-half cuffs. His socks were white and his loafers black. His skin was yellow when it wasn't just grim, and an unfiltered Camel hung from rubber lips. Fred was a lifelong bachelor. Suffice it to say, he didn't get a lot of chicks. What Fred did get was information. The man shambling along Michigan Avenue had won two Pulitzers and represented probably the best investigative reporter this side of Bob Woodward. I pulled the car up but Fred just kept walking. I'd seen this before and rolled down the window.<br><br>"You getting in, Fred?"<br><br>He squinted through a layer of cigarette smoke, motioned with one hand, and talked out of the side of his mouth.<br><br>"Keep moving. I'll meet you around the corner."<br><br>When it came to paranoia, the NSA had nothing on Fred Jacobs. I pulled around the block and waited. It took a minute or two, but he finally slipped alongside my car and got in.<br><br>"Just drive straight."<br><br>"It's a one-way street, Fred."<br><br>"Even better. Get going, for chrissakes."<br><br>I popped the car into drive and found my way around the block.<br><br>"A lot of people watching you these days, Fred?"<br><br>"Fuck off, Kelly. First of all, you're never anything but trouble. Second, you don't work my beat. You don't do what I do. So you don't know anything about what people see and don't see."<br><br>Like I said, great reporter. A little touched in the head, but what the hell.<br><br>"Where are we going to eat?" he said.<br><br>I'd told Fred I'd buy him lunch. He knew that meant I needed information. Of course, Fred expected something in return. Like a story. Maybe another Pulitzer. Probably not. But for someone who weighed no more than the typical calico, Fred Jacobs also liked to eat. Big time.<br><br>"I thought we'd go over to Mitchell's," I said.<br><br>"We're going to the Goat. Take a left here."<br><br>I swung a left off Michigan Avenue and then another at State Street. Jacobs sucked up the last quarter of his cigarette and pushed the butt out an open window. Smoke curled softly from each nostril as the reporter rolled up the window and chuckled to himself.<br><br>"Got to hand it to you, Kelly."<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>"You stuck it to that TV bitch but good."<br><br>He was talking about Diane Lindsay, former Chicago news anchor, convicted killer, and someone I used to sleep with.<br><br>"You think so, Fred?"<br><br>"Fuck, yes. Talking heads think they invented the news. No respect for journalism. No respect for the process."<br><br>"And putting Diane Lindsay in the slam made that right?"<br><br>"Didn't make it right. But damn, it was fun to watch. Pull over here."<br><br>I dropped into an empty spot on Hubbard Street and the two of us got out. The Billy Goat Tavern is located on the lower level of Michigan Avenue. Most people walk down a set of stairs in front of the Wrigley Building on upper Michigan. Apparently that was a little too public for Jacobs, so we came in from Hubbard.<br><br>"The Billy Goat isn't exactly low profile, Fred."<br><br>"Not a problem. I eat here eight days a week. Someone like you sits down at my table, what am I supposed to do? So I let you buy me a burger and listen to your bullshit."<br><br>"That's the story?"<br><br>"That's the story. Come on."<br><br>Jacobs opened the heavy metal door, painted red with a black-and-white goat. We walked down a greasy set of steps and into a Chicago legend.<br>CHAPTER 3<br><br>The Billy Goat was more cave than tavern and was everything Royko and Belushi ever made it out to be. Four sets of Greek eyes watched as we walked through the door. Spatulas in hand, they started jabbering about cheeseburgers and chips even before we stepped up to the counter. The menu board was a mildewed version of yellow with black plastic letters, unevenly spaced and mostly misspelled. A cheeseburger cost three bucks. Everyone ordered a double, of course--mostly because it was only a buck extra. Also because that's what the guy behind the counter was making no matter what you ordered. Throw some onions and pickles on your double, then go sit at the elbow of the bar with the white linoleum top. Also known as the Wise Guys' Corner. Watch the regulars drink beer, talk about the mayor, the Bears, the Sox, Chicago. Then, now, forever. Leave the Billy Goat, walk the world for a year or two, and return. They'd still be there. Same guys, or ones just like them. Drinking a Billy Goat draft, light or dark. Rolling out the history of their city. Pushing at the past, pulling it into the present. Arguing and exaggerating. Preserving what's been and making it come to life again. All for the price of a drink and available seven days a week, in the home of the Goat.<br><br>"Double cheeseburger, Mr. Jacobs?"<br><br>The counterman knew my reporter friend, which wasn't a surprise. Jacobs ordered two double cheeseburgers, which wasn'...</p><h2>The Year of Yes</h2><p><strong>The "poignant and hilarious" (<em>Newsday</em></strong>) story of one woman's twelve months of dating anyone -- absolutely anyone -- who asked her out <p>At some point every woman who's single (and not by choice) wonders whether she's not somehow responsible for her predicament. Is she too choosy? Should she have given that guy with the combover and the mother issues a shot? Maybe three full feet isnt too much of a height difference . . .? Maria Dahvana Headley had been there, cherry-picking the men shed dated based on a variety of criteria, and clearly it wasnt getting her anywhere. </p><p><em>The Year of Yes</em> is the hilarious and hopeful account of Headley's quest to find a man she could stand (for longer than a couple of hours). Frustrated by her own ineffective taste, she resolved to leave her love life up to fate, dating anyone who asked her: homeless men, a millionaire, several non-English speakers, a mime, and even two women. And finally, one man whose baggage would have disqualified him in any other year . . . but this was the Year of Yes, when Headley would finally discover what was really important. </p></p><p>Maria Dahvana Headleys work has been published in several anthologies and literary journals. She lives in Seattle with her husband and his two children.When Idaho-born Headley, a 20-year-old NYU drama student, laments, "I felt like I'd dated and then hated every man in Manhattan," she thinks perhaps she's too critical. So she "decided that I would say yes to every man who asked me out on a date." It sounds disastrous, even scary, though she chose to exclude the drunk, the drugged, the violent, and cheating husbands. The first date was the Puerto Rican handyman who came to fix the toilet with his daughter in tow, the second a 40-year-old who spoke only Polish. One took her to a strip joint, one wanted his penis bitten, one was a woman and one asked her to marry him on the first date. One of the nicest turned out to be the 70-year-old Latino who made obscene sucking noises and claimed to have 11 children. The one Headley got a crush on turned out to be "mostly gay." And then what happened? Believe it or not&#x2014;true love. Reader, she married him. It's sheer chick fluff, but amusing, with names changed "to protect the indignant, the infantile, and, of course, the innocent." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She was the daughter of Henry's first queen, Katharine of Aragon, and was heir presumptive to the throne of England. Red-haired like her father, she was also intelligent and deeply religious like her staunchly Catholic mother. But her father's ill-fated love for Anne Boleyn would shatter Mary's life forever. The father who had once adored her was now intent on having a male heir at all costs. He divorced her mother and, at the age of twelve, Mary was banished from her father&#x2019;s presence, stripped of her royal title, and replaced by his other children--first Elizabeth, then Edward. Worst of all, she never saw her beloved mother again; Katharine was exiled too, and died soon after. Lonely and miserable, Mary turned for comfort to the religion that had sustained her mother.<br><br>In a stroke of fate, however, Henry's much-longed-for son died in his teens, leaving Mary the legitimate heir to the throne. It was, she felt, a sign from God--proof that England should return to the Catholic Church. Swayed by fanatical advisors and her own religious fervor, Mary made horrific examples of those who failed to embrace the Church, earning her the immortal nickname "Bloody Mary." She was married only once, to her Spanish cousin Philip II--a loveless and childless marriage that brought her to the edge of madness.<br><br>With <b>In the Shadow of the Crown</b>, Jean Plaidy brings to life the dark story of a queen whose road to the throne was paved with sorrow.</p><p>JEAN PLAIDY, one of the preeminent authors of historical fiction for most of the twentieth century, is the pen name of the prolific English author Eleanor Hibbert, also known as Victoria Holt. Jean Plaidy&#x2019;s novels had sold more than 14 million copies worldwide by the time of her death in 1993.The Betrothal <br><br> I have taken for my motto "Time unveils Truth," and I believe that is often to be the case. Now that I am sick, weary and soon to die, I have looked back over my life which, on the whole, has been a sad and bitter one, though, like most people, I have had some moments of happiness. Perhaps it was my ill fortune to come into the world under the shadow of the crown, and through all my days that shadow remained with me&#x2014;my right to it; my ability to capture it; my power to hold it.<br><br>No child's arrival could have been more eagerly awaited than mine. It was imperative for my mother to give the country an heir. She had already given birth to a stillborn daughter, a son who had survived his christening only to depart a few weeks later, another son who died at birth, and there had been a premature delivery. The King, my father, was beginning to grow impatient, asking himself why God had decided to punish him thus; my mother was silently frantic, fearing that the fault was hers. None could believe that my handsome father, godlike in his physical perfection, could fail where the humblest beggar in the streets could succeed.<br><br>I was unaware at the time, of course, but I heard later of all the excitement and apprehension the hope of my coming brought with it.<br><br>Then, at four o'clock on the morning of the 18th of February in that year 1516, I was born in the Palace of Greenwich.<br><br>After the first disappointment due to my sex being of the wrong gender, there was general rejoicing&#x2014;less joyous, of course, than if I had been a boy, but still I was alive and appeared to be healthy and, as I believe my father remarked to my poor mother, who had just emerged from the exhaustion of a difficult labor, the child was well formed, and they could have more . . . a boy next time, then a quiverful.<br><br>Bells rang out. The King and Queen could at least have a child who had a chance of living. Perhaps some remembered that other child, the precious boy who had given rise to even greater rejoicing and a few weeks later had died in the midst of the celebrations for his birth. But I was here, a royal child, the daughter of the King and Queen, and until the longed-for boy arrived to displace me, I was heir to the throne.<br><br>I enjoyed hearing of my splendid baptism from both Lady Bryan, who was the lady mistress of the Household, and the Countess of Salisbury, who became my state governess. It had taken place on the third day after my birth, for according to custom christenings must take place as soon as possible in case the child did not survive. It took place in Greyfriar's Church close to Greenwich Palace, and the silver font had been brought from Christ Church in Canterbury, for all the children of my grandparents, Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, had had this silver font at their baptisms, and it was fitting that it should be the same for me. Carpets had been laid from the Palace to the font, and the Countess of Salisbury had the great honor of carrying me in her arms.<br><br>My father had decreed that I should be named after his sister Mary. She had always been a favorite of his, even after her exploits in France the previous year which had infuriated him. It showed the depth of his affection for her that he could have given me her name when she had so recently displeased him by marrying the Duke of Suffolk almost immediately after the death of her husband, Louis XII of France. She was more or less in exile at the time of my christening, in disgrace and rather poor, for she and Suffolk had to pay back to my father the dowry which he had paid to the French. In the years to come I liked to remind myself of that unexpected softness in his nature, and I drew a little comfort from it.<br><br>My godfather was Cardinal Wolsey who, under the King, was the most important man in the country at that time. He gave me a gold cup; from my Aunt Mary, the wayward Tudor after whom I was named, I received a pomander. I loved it. It was a golden ball into which was inserted a paste of exquisite perfumes. I used to take it to bed with me and later I wore it at my girdle.<br><br>The best time of my life was my early childhood before I had an inkling of the storms which were to beset me. Innocence is a beautiful state when one believes that people are all good and one is prepared to love them all and expect that love to be returned. One is unaware that evil exists, so one does not look for it. But, alas, there comes the awakening.<br><br>A royal child has no secret life. He or she is watched constantly, and it is particularly so if that child is important to the state. I say this as no conceit. I was important because I was the only child of the King, and if my parents produced the desired boy, my importance would dwindle away. I should not have been watched over, inspected by ambassadors and received their homage due to the heir to the throne. It is difficult to understand when one is young that the adulation and respect are not for oneself but for the Crown.<br><br>There are vague memories in my mind, prompted no doubt by accounts I heard from members of my household; but I see myself at the age of two being taken up by my father, held high while he threw me up and caught me in his strong arms and held me firmly against his jewel-encrusted surcoat. I had felt no qualms that he would drop me. I never knew anyone exude power as my father did. As a child I believed him to be different from all others, a being apart. Of course, I had always seen him as the most powerful person in the kingdom&#x2014;which undoubtedly he was&#x2014;and my childish mind endowed him with divine qualities. He was not only a king; he was a god. My mother and Sir Henry Rowte, my priest, chaplain and Clerk of the Closet, might instruct me in my duties to One who was above us all, but in my early days that one was my father.<br><br>I was so happy to be held in his arms and to see my beloved mother standing beside me, laughing, happy, beautiful and contented with me.<br><br>I remember my father's carrying me to a man in red robes who reverently took my hand and kissed it. My father regarded this man with great affection, and it seemed wonderful to me that he should kiss my hand. It meant something. It pleased my father. I knew by that time that he was my godfather, the great Cardinal Wolsey.<br><br>That had been when I was exactly two years old. I think the ceremony must have been in recognition of that fact. It was not only the great Cardinal who kissed my hand. I was taken to the Venetian ambassador and he was presented to me. I had been told I had to extend my hand for him to kiss, which I did in the manner which had been taught me, and I knew this caused my father's mouth to turn up at the corners with approval. Several people were presented to me afterward and I believe I remember something of this. While I was in my father's arms, I saw a man in dark robes among the assembly. I knew him for a priest. Priests, I had been told, were holy men, good men. I was drawn to them all throughout my life. I wanted to see this one more closely, so I called out, "Priest, Priest. Come here, Priest."<br><br>There was astonishment among the company, and my father beckoned to the man to come forward. He did and stood before me. He took my hand and kissed it. I touched his dark robes and said: "Stay here, Priest." The man smiled at me and, basking in my approval, he overcame his awe of the King and stammered out that the Princess Mary was a child of many gifts and the most bright and intelligent of her age he had ever seen.<br><br>People remember that occasion more for the manner in which I summoned the priest than that it was my second birthday and that the King was showing his love for me and that he was becoming reconciled to the fact that he might never have a legitimate son to follow him, which would make me, his daughter, his heir. I was at that time at Ditton in Buckinghamshire. On the other side of the river was Windsor Castle and there was frequent traffic between the two places. I looked forward to those occasions when the ferryman rowed us across the river. I had my household governed by the Countess of Salisbury, who was a mother to me when my own beloved mother was not able to be with me. She deplored these absences, I knew, and had made me understand that she loved me dearly, and in spite of my reverence for my father, she was the person I loved best in the whole world.<br><br>Whenever she visited the household, she and the Countess would talk of me. My mother wanted to know everything I did and said and wore. She made me feel cherished; and the greatest sorrow of my early life was due to those occasions when we had to part.<br><br>She would say: "Soon we shall be together again and when I am not here the lady Countess will be your mother in my place."<br><br>"There can only be one mother," I told her gravely.<br><br>"That is so, my child," she answered. "But you love the Countess as she loves you, and you must do everything she tells you and above all remember that she is there . . . for me."<br><br>I did understand. I was wise for my years. I had, as Alice Wood, the laundress used to say, "an old head on little shoulders."<br><br>Soon after that, when I was two years and eight months old, my first betrothal took place.<br><br>A son had been born to Francoise Premier, the King of France, and my father and the Cardinal believed that it would strengthen the friendship between our two countries if a marriage was arranged for us. Although I was almost exactly two years older&#x2014;the Dauphin was born on the 28th of February 1518&#x2014;we were of an age. I had no notion of what this was all about. I do vaguely remember the splendid ceremony at Greenwich Palace, largely because of the clothes I had to wear. They were heavy and prickly; my gown was of cloth of gold, and my black velvet cap so encrusted with jewels that I could scarcely support its weight. My prospective bridegroom, being only eight months old, was naturally spared the ceremony and a somewhat solemn-looking Admiral Bonnivet represented him. I remember the heavy diamond ring he put on my finger.<br><br>The great Cardinal celebrated Mass. I was too uncomfortable in my unwieldy garments to be anything but pleased when it was all over.<br><br>The Countess told me that it was a very important occasion and it meant that one day I should be Queen of France. I need not be alarmed. The ceremony would not be repeated until the Dauphin was fourteen years old&#x2014;by which time I should be sixteen . . . eons away in time. Then I should go to France to be prepared for the great honor of queenship.<br><br>My mother did not share in the general rejoicing. I learned at an early age that she did not like the French.<br><br>I was three years old when an event took place which was of the greatest importance to my mother and therefore to me, although, of course, at this stage of my life I was blissfully ignorant of it and of the storms which had begun to cast a cloud over my parents' marriage.<br><br>Later I heard all about it.<br><br>I had sensed that there had been a certain disappointment at my birth because I was not a boy, and I was aware some time before my third birthday that there was an expectancy in the Court which had seeped into my household. People whispered. I caught a word here and there. I think I must have been rather precocious. I suppose any child in my position would have been. I did not know what the undercurrents meant but I did somehow sense that they were there.<br><br>My mother was ill and I heard it murmured that this was yet another disappointment, though "it" would only have been a girl. The King was angry; the Queen was desolate. It was yet another case of hope unfulfillled.<br><br>"Well, there is time yet," I heard it said. "And after all there is the little Princess."<br><br>And then a boy was born&#x2014;not to my mother, though. He was a very important boy, but he could not displace me. He was flawed in some way. He was&#x2014;I heard the word spoken with pity and a touch of contempt&#x2014;a bastard.<br><br>But there was something special about this bastard.<br><br>I learned the story later. Bessie Blount was not the King's first mistress. How my poor mother must have suffered! She, the daughter of proud Isabella and Ferdinand, to be forced to accept such a state of affairs. Men were not faithful . . . kings in particular . . . but they should veil their infidelities with discretion. I heard many tales of Bessie Blount; how she was the star of the Court, how she sang more prettily and danced more gracefully than any other; and how the King, tiring of his Spanish Queen who, in any case was more than five years his senior, was like every other man at Court fascinated by her.<br><br>There had been another woman before Bessie Blount's arrival on the scene. She was the sister of the Duke of Buckingham and was at Court with her husband. The Duke of Buckingham considered himself more royal than the Tudors. His father was descended from Thomas of Woodstock, who was a son of Edward III, and his mother had been Catherine Woodville, sister to Elizabeth, Queen of Edward IV. So he had good reasons&#x2014;particularly as the Plantagenets were inclined to regard the Tudors as upstarts. My own dear Countess of Salisbury was very proud of her Plantagenet ancestry but she was wise enough not to talk of it.</p><h2>Love Lessons</h2><p>Schoolgirl nymphs and lustful tomboys long for caressing touches and spanking discipline in these ten vignettes drawn from suppressed chapters of Victorian erotica.</p><p></p><h2>Bird of Prey</h2><p>When a killer satellite known as Zeus emperils astronaut Kelsey Newton and her crewmates aboard the International Space Station, it is up to her fianc�, ex-Navy SEAL Nolan Kilkenny, to uncover the truth about the diabolical weapon and the megalomaniacal tycoon who controls its. Original.</p><p><b>Tom Grace</b> is the bestselling author of the Nolan Kilkenny thrillers <i>Spyder Web, Quantum Web,</i> and <i>Twisted Web.</i> In researching his novels, Grace has traveled from the navy yard at Pearl Harbor to the frozen expanse of the North Pole. He is a gentleman-architect and lives in Michigan with his wife and children.As Nolan Kilkenny, a Navy SEAL turned scientist, watches his fianc�e, Kelsey Newton, launch into space to deploy a communications satellite, he thinks of the dangers he faced as a SEAL and the dangers she now faces as an astronaut and muses, "At least no one up in space is trying to kill you." He soon realizes how wrong he is, however, when a black ship carrying a high-powered laser takes aim at the satellite, then the shuttle itself. Kelsey makes it safely to the international space station, while Nolan tries to find out who is firing upon the satellites and why. His investigation takes him around the globe in an exciting cat-and-mouse chase with a Russian assassin and leads him to an enormous global corporation run by a ruthless woman willing to commit high-tech murder to stop her competitors. The narrative cuts quickly from place to place, culminating in a tense showdown at sea. Grace's prose recalls Ian Fleming at his most lean, and although the focus is on the ticking time bomb in orbit, Grace (Twisted Web, etc.) throws in a wealth of technical details and gadgetry to satisfy techno-thriller aficionados. This is a complex story with an enormous cast of characters, but Grace keeps the plot clean and streamlined, making this a brisk, enjoyable read. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Addressing concerns and fears about the state of evangelism, Dodson offers a blend of wisdom and grace.<br><br>Part apologetics, part theology, part practical guidance in evangelism, this book finishes with insightful, authentic stories of mission from the trenches. Here is what evangelism in late modern culture could look like.&nbsp;</p><p><b>JONATHAN DODSON (M.Div, ThM)&nbsp;</b>is the founding pastor of City Life Church in Austin, Texas which he started with his wife, Robie, and small group of people. He has also held leadership positions in various missional networks and is author of&nbsp;<i>Gospel-Centered Discipleship </i>and<i> Raised? Finding Jesus by Doubting the Resurrection</i>.Jonathan Dodson gives thoughtful counsel on how to communicate the gospel to our secular culture today. He is right on target. He is honest. This is evangelism for the twenty-first century---and for all centuries, for that matter! -- Robert E. Coleman, Distinguished Professor of Evangelism and Discipleship at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and author of The Master Plan of Evangelism<br><br>How did it happen that the gospel we preach has been rejected as bad news by our culture? In The Unbelievable Gospel, Jonathan Dodson opens up this puzzle. Reading it gave me confidence, liberated my imagination, and gave me a pathway to an evangelism that lives the gospel as well as tells it. It is a stunningly clarifying book. -- David Fitch, Lindner Chair of Evangelical Theology, Northern Seminary, and author of Prodigal Christianity<br><br>What is unbelievable about The Unbelievable Gospel is that its message is so needed and we haven&#x2019;t had a well-written practical book on it until now. Jonathan Dodson really cares about how the church is talking to the world. He has demonstrated as much in his personal life, especially how he continued to hold his own feet to the fire in the first years of his church. He would not accept numeric church growth as success, for he had higher standards. His genuine humility comes through as he tells the church what it needs to hear and how it can talk to the world so they will listen. The contents of this work could educate and set free a congregation to communicate the gospel effectively with the people they care about. -- Bill Hull, author of The Disciple-Making Pastor, Christlike, The Disciple-Making Church, and The Complete Book of Discipleship<br><br>The gospel does not change, but we must always be attentive to how we can best communicate it afresh to each generation. Jonathan Dodson in The Unbelievable Gospel demonstrates, once again, that he is one of the church&#x2019;s leading thinkers in knowing how to present the gospel effectively in an increasingly postmodern world. I highly recommend it! -- Timothy C. Tennent, President, Asbury Theological Seminary, Professor of World Christianity<br><br>If you are passionate about the gospel but despair at the difficulty of communicating the good news of Jesus in the urban, creative contexts of the West, then The Unbelievable Gospel is for you. A compelling and empowering guide to sharing faith today. -- Mark Sayers, Red Church in Melbourne, �ber, and author of The Road Trip That Changed the World and Facing Leviathan<br><br>There is no doubt that we need to rethink much about the way we have shared the gospel in America. So much of our evangelism bears false witness to the very gospel we seek to promote. Jonathan&#x2019;s thoughtful and well-researched book provides both a great antidote and good guidance at the same time. Anyone interested in the integrity of the gospel and how it is communicated should read this book. -- Alan Hirsch, Founder of Forge Missional Training Network and Future Travelers; award-winning author of numerous books, including Untamed and Right Here Right Now<br><br>There is always a need to communicate the unchanging gospel using language and forms that can be understood by emerging generations. If you have a passion to share the good news of Jesus, this book is for you. -- Darrin Patrick, lead pastor of The Journey; vice president of Acts 29; chaplain to the St. Louis Cardinals; author of The Dude&#x2019;s Guide to Manhood<br><br>Over the past decade, I&#x2019;ve sifted through boatloads of books related to spreading the message of Christ&#x2019;s gospel. I have poured slowly through the most popular books on the subject, but have always found myself longing for something more. The Unbelievable Gospel contains what my heart has been yearning for: an evangelistic manifesto that every Christian should read. It is the best evangelism book I&#x2019;ve ever read, by far. -- Matt Brown, evangelist, author of Awakening: Why the Next Great Move of God Is Right under Our Nose, founder of Think Eternity<br><br>All of us encounter not-yet Christians on a daily basis, and for one reason or another, we often fail to engage these people with the greatest story ever told: the gospel. We each come to the table with reasons for not sharing Jesus. Jonathan brilliantly gives us a soul-check and reminds us that evangelism can be winsome and fun when done with a heart transfixed by the person of Jesus and his work in the world. For those of us without the gift of evangelism, Jonathan encourages us that, yes, we can indeed share a believable gospel---not because of who we are or what we do, but because of what our great Savior has done for us. -- Laurie Fortunak Nichols, editor of the Evangelvision blog, director of communications at the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College, and managing editor for Evangelical Missions Quarterly</p><h2>Admiring Silence</h2><p>As a successor to his Booker-nominated novel, Paradise, Abdulrazak Gurnah&#39;s fifth book, Admiring Silence, presents the despair of being torn from one&#39;s roots. Gurnah&#39;s unnamed narrator flees to England as a teenager to escape the violent political rule of his native island in Zanzibar. There he lives for nearly twenty years in suburban comfort with an Englishwoman and holds a respectable position teaching at a university. Despite his apparent success, as an immigrant he is caught in cultural limbo, always feeling marginal in British society. The tales he weaves for his English lover and her family of an idyllic past in Africa console him temporarily, but when sanctions are lifted the narrator chooses to leave the family he created in England and return to Zanzibar. What he finds there destroys the image of the childhood paradise he had preserved in his heart-now he can never return home.</p><p>From the author of the novel <i>Paradise</i> and nonfiction works <i>Essays on African Writing 1: A Re-Evaluation</i> and <i>Essays on African Writing 2: Contemporary Literature</i> comes <i>Admiring Silence</i>, the tale of an African man hopelessly enmeshed in a trap of his own making. After fleeing Zanzibar for England, the nameless narrator fathers a child by an English woman and struggles to come to terms with the racism he must confront as well as his ambivalence toward becoming part of English society. The brittle and fragile existence he builds for himself comes crashing down during a visit to his native land after many years away. There he realizes that he is an outcast from both worlds. <i>Admiring Silence</i> is a bitter and often bitterly funny look at the struggle to belong in an alien world.Gurnah (Paradise, 1994), born in Zanzibar, poignantly redefines the colonial experience as he details the ``disappointed love'' that an exile feels for both the colonial mother, England, and his now independent homeland. Suffering from heart disease and homesickness, the 40-year-old unnamed narrator decides to make his first return to the island of Zanzibar since fleeing it as a teenager when its new rulers, after obtaining independence from Britain, began a reign of terror. As a member of the Arab community made up of the descendants of merchants and slave traders who settled there centuries before, he had felt especially vulnerable. Once in England, he completed high school, went to college, became a teacher. He also met Emma Willoughby, brilliant, white, and determined to shock her pleasant, conventional parents. The narrator fell in love with her and wooed her with fictional tales of his past. He did the same with Emma's father, though in this case, rather than evoking the idyllic family existence in an African setting enjoyed by Emma, he tells stories that reflect the old Empire's benevolence. Since Emma disapproved of marriage, the two lived together, had a daughter, Amelia, and for years he was happy, though he never wrote to his family in Zanzibar or visited them. And now the island, he finds on his return, has become a place where the toilets are blocked, the sewers broken, and the stores empty. The government is marginally more benign than the one it replaced in a coup, but the leaders are corrupt, cynical, and unable to govern. Home seems no longer home, and when his family, angered about his relationship with Emma, turns on him, he goes back, his fables confounded, to England, another place that is no longer home--for by now, Emma has found another man. A beautifully calibrated story of a wrenching search for a home for the heart and soul in an age of immigrants and exiles. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

An active conservationist, she lives in the lowcountry of South Carolina, where she is at work on her next novel.Luz Avila's mother abandoned her when she was a very young child to be raised by her grandmother, who she calls Abuela. When Luz is a grown woman, Abuela insists on making a trip to her home village, Angangueo, in Mexico, where the monarch butterflies migrate each year, but Luz is reluctant to interrupt her life. Abuela dies before they can make the trip, and Luz, tormented by regrets, decides to make the journey with Abuela's ashes, driving from Milwaukee to Mexico, following the path of the butterflies. Along the way, Luz meets extraordinary women who transform her: a tough but gentle young girl scarred by life; a free-spirited wanderer; a prim and proper woman who has lost opportunities.

In the years before radio and television could bring our leaders into our living rooms, Lincoln communicated to citizens through powerful letters and brilliant speeches. He even wrote poetry! Noted Lincoln scholar and lecturer Harold Holzer gathers Abraham Lincoln&#39;s greatest writings--from his early rhymes composed when he was about sixteen to his speech to Indiana soldiers delivered less than a month before his death--and illustrates them with poignant archival black-and-white photographs and prints. Holzer divides the book into two parts--The Illinois Years: 1825-1860 and The White House Years: 1861-1865--and provides detailed backgrounds to these important stages of Lincoln&#39;s life. Each writing is also accompanied by an introduction that offers historical background. And the timeline of key events in Lincoln&#39;s life helps put this extraordinary figure in perspective. Holzer proves that there is no better way to get to know Lincoln than through the magic of his words.</p><p><p><b>Harold Holzer </b>is the author of <i>The Lincoln Mailbag; The Lincoln Image; Lincoln on Democracy; Dear Mr.&nbsp;Lincoln: Letters to the President; </i>and for young readers <i>The Civil War Era.&nbsp;</i>He is vice president&nbsp;for communications at&nbsp;The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and lives in Rye,&nbsp;New York.&nbsp;</p>Grade 7 Up-Holzer presents a sampling of writings that offer a unique look at the 16th president's life and the power of his words. The introduction, "Lincoln in His Own Write," reviews the man's development as a writer. The first section traces his career as lawyer, congressman, Senate candidate, until his acceptance of the Republican presidential nomination. It includes early poems; letters to his wife and brother; notes on the law, the role of government, and democracy; and excerpts from speeches on the Dred Scott Decision and a "House Divided," as well as from the Lincoln-Douglas Debates. "The White House Years, 1861-1865" illuminates the president through his inaugural addresses, letters to generals, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Gettysburg Address, and letters to his sons. Each sample of writing is preceded by an informative introduction. An excellent selection of archival black-and-white photographs and reproductions enriches the text.

My mother was forty-two when she gave birth to me, and my father was forty-one. According to my mother, I was an extremely thin infant, not much bigger than a kitten. She said many people thought I looked like a rat. That is why my parents named me Baokang (Stay Healthy).<br><br>I was born near Xiaoniang (Young Lady) Harbor, just west of where the Yangzi River empties into the East China Sea. I have no memory of the place because a few months after I came into the world, a flood washed everything away, not just our home but our fields, too. Everything we owned ended up in the middle of the river.<br><br>After the flood, we stayed with relatives near Nantong. Then we moved farther upriver, about 150 kilometers from the sea, to a district called Changyinsha directly across from Nantong's harbor. We lived in a three-room thatched hut my father put up on an acre of rented farmland.<br><br>Summer days were hot; nights, a cool wind blew in from the river through walls of loosely woven reeds. Snow covered us in the winter; we mud-plastered cracks in the thatch against the cold. When there was money for oil to fill the small stone lamps, wicked with scraps of old cloth, my mother and sisters did needlework, sewing, and spinning. My father and brothers made hemp rope and shoes of woven grass.<br><br>We all slept in our clothes in one room on beds that were really just wooden boards on four legs with hay underneath us and cotton quilts on top. We woke to a breakfast of corn or oats. Sometimes there was no money for salt.<br><br>My job as the youngest child was to go out into the fields and collect the night waste. I would shovel dog, horse, and donkey dung into a grass basket, slide the shovel through the basket's bamboo handles, and heave the load up onto my shoulder and then set off searching for the next pile of dung. A hook on the shovel's handle held the handle of the basket in place. The night waste, and our own excrement (collected in a large clay jar from our rickety outhouse), fertilized the fields.<br>My father and brothers were accomplished fishermen, both with nets and by wading into the shallow Yangzi channels and snaring fish by hand. Our house was built on a raised piece of land between two of the river's channels. The Yangzi dominated the landscape. It was huge, deep, and cold. The land was flat under a big sky. Dikes lined the river and the roads were raised. There were no trees except on the riverbanks. All arable land was in crops.<br><br>We pumped water from the river to irrigate our fields. A man sat on a bicycle, steadily pedaling, powering a water-wheel with buckets that drew river water into the fields. We tilled the fields with buffalo. They were friends that worked for us, so we didn't see them as food. Our family didn't own a buffalo; we borrowed one.<br><br>In addition to collecting dung, I had to gather grass to feed our pigs and goats. We needed to cook the grass for the pigs, but the goats ate it raw. We fed them grass because if we fed them other food we wouldn't have anything to eat. We sold our livestock for oil, sugar, salt, and cloth. It was a rare occasion when we ate meat.<br><br>Often, my father and brothers worked for other landowners, far from home. They brought their lunch with them, and pots and pans for cooking in the fields. They would leave our hut in the morning, toting all their tools: short-handled shovels that looked like cricket mallets, sickles, iron hooks to dig up the stems and roots of soybeans, and bamboo baskets for carrying mud. We grew rye, cotton, soybeans, rice, wheat, green vegetables, carrots, gourds, peanuts, and lily bulbs for medicinal oil.<br>At home, we cooked over a small fire of cotton and soybean stems. Our kitchen countertop was clay-faced brick. Our utensils were chopsticks and rough ceramic bowls from which we shoveled up our gruel three times a day. The bowls were as heavy and thick as stone--if you dropped them they wouldn't break. For lunch and dinner, we added sweet potato sticks and pickled vegetables to our gruel. Salty fermented daikon set off the bland porridge and was a special treat.<br><br>We had little, and the work was hard. Yet from my perspective, in my memory, our life was happy. My parents were a perfect couple. I never saw them fight; they never even quarreled. This was mainly because my mother was a very smart, very competent person. All my father had to do was work the fields and provide us with food and money. My mother dominated the family; she ran our lives. My father was grateful. He accepted her strength, and, in return, my mother was loving toward him. Their mutual devotion deeply affected me. Whenever I interact with people, I try to harmonize with them, in the way my father did to my mother. He bent his actions, his thoughts, and his heart to her wisdom and will.<br><br>Seven years after we moved to Changyinsha I saw for myself what a flood can do, although it didn't affect us directly because we lived several kilometers from the river. I remember that it rained for over a month. The typhoons came and came and came. The winds rose and rose and kept blowing. The rain was dense and lashing. It would storm for days, the sky would lighten briefly, and then the rains would begin again, waves of rain, soaking everything. After the first week or so, the Yangzi started to rise. It started pulling in the land on its banks, sucking the land into itself, getting fatter and fatter, faster and faster, gobbling up soil and trees. It swelled so much that it broke through the dikes into the fields. We didn't need the bicycle man to irrigate now: our fields were full of fish!<br>When the typhoons finally stopped and the wind died down, my father took me to see how my second sister's family had fared. Although the flood had spared their house, their land was outside the dike and had disappeared. In places where the water had begun to recede, all that was left of other houses were thatched roofs. Debris floated in the water, half-starved dogs and cats clung to flotsam, and human corpses bobbed in the waves. Their clothes had been stripped off, and they had begun to bloat and rot.<br><br>The male corpses floated facedown, their bodies arched like bows with only their backs visible above the water. I thought this was because their stomachs had less fat, but I never found out why. Most of the female corpses floated face up. Their heads were bent back, their hair was fanned, and their feet hung down below the surface. They also formed bows, but in the opposite direction. The children's corpses were bloated like blowfish, swollen and puffed up with sickly white bellies and leprous gray backs. Ducks scavenged their eyeballs. The rain had stopped, the sun beat down, and waves of stench drifted off the river.<br><br>It was such an awful experience. Over the next few weeks I kept waking up in the middle of the night in terror. The fragility of life is frightening--not only to adults, but to children, too. The destruction I witnessed was like what Shakyamuni Buddha realized upon enlightenment: that this world is fragile and constantly in danger. The cycle of birth and death is like an ocean of suffering.<br>At that time I had absolutely no religious beliefs. But standing over the fetid river, watching the corpses drift by, I had a sudden realization that any of us can die at any time. I knew that if we had lived in that area we would have died, too. Seeing so many corpses, the impermanence of life was driven home to me. Yet I felt that it was a very good thing to be alive. In the midst of all that terror, it was not fear that I felt, but that life is good and that we should cherish it. In the weeks to come, the horror of the corpses faded and was replaced with a kind of acceptance. At a young age, I knew that when death comes there is nothing we can do; we have to accept it.<br><br>I have seen much death in my lifetime--war, famine, disease. I am at the end of my life now. One day soon I will die. The lesson of the flood is still with me, and I know that there is no use worrying about death. The important thing is to live fully until the moment when it comes.<br>2 The Open Door<br><br>As a child I was always very weak and sickly. I began to walk at three, and didn't talk until five. I was a horrendously slow learner. There was a pendulum clock on the wall at home. My parents and siblings all tried to teach me how to tell time, but it was beyond me. I remember my puzzlement at this great mystery of telling time, and the unfathomable meaning of the arrows pointing in weird directions like ciphers. I loved watermelon, but at age five I could not say the word "watermelon." I knew only that when we ate watermelon we needed to split them open, so I referred to watermelons as "open." My family was sure that I was going to be an idiot when I grew up.<br><br>Because I was so slow, I was given the simpleton's job of caring for our goats. I didn't really know what to do with them, so I would bring them to the stream or another nice place for them to graze and leave them there.<br>"Where are the goats?" my mother would ask me when I came home.<br>"The goats wanted to graze and not come back," I would reply, and my parents would have to go fetch the goats themselves. They eventually decided that I should just gather grass for the goats. This also was beyond me: the goats were picky and ate only one type of grass, and I did not know which type to collect. I often came home with a bunch of grass that they wouldn't touch.<br>I spent much of my time alone. There was no one to play with; my parents and siblings were busy every waking moment. During the day I would go and hide in the wheat fields, especially in places where broad beans were cultivated. Their flowers had a very nice fragrance and the beans were a handy snack. I didn't know there was a boundary between our field and our neighbor's. I have an early memory of lying dreamily on my back on a summer day, under a close canopy of ...</p><h2>The Haymeadow</h2><p>Fourteen-year-old John Barron is asked, like his father and grandfather before him, to spend the summer taking care of their sheep in the haymeadow.

And though her book is dense with facts, it reads like poetry or a series of koans. The reader can feel the author&#x2019;s presence, the inspiration of her roosters and dog, and the rhythmic shadow of trees and winter grass outside her window.

Novelist, playwright, scriptwriter, artist and director, he is a master at twisting the mundane to make it fantastic, frightening and ultimately meaningful.</p><p>Douglas E. Winter's detailed and highly literate biography, made possible by unprecedented access to Barker and his closest friends and family, offers readers a privileged insight into Barker's own story: his Liverpool childhood and adolescence; his forays into the world of theatre, mime and direction; his meteoric rise to fame as the author of the <em>Books of Blood</em> and <em>Weaveworld,</em> and the director of <em>Hellraiser</em>; his move to Hollywood to pursue a film career and his growth as an artist in many different media, which has taken him from theatre -- the first form of human expression -- into the digital age.</p><p>Interwoven with this revealing and personal journey into Barker's life is a grand tour through all of his fiction and film, from his earliest unpublished work -- including the short story "The Wood on the Hill," which is published here for the first time -- up to his most recent novel, <em>Coldheart Canyon</em> and beyond, giving a tantalising glimpse of things to come.</p><p><em>Clive Barker: The Dark Fantastic</em> unlocks the beating heart of a polymath, a creator, a true artist, and reveals at last a man with one of the twentieth century's most phenomenal imaginations, and the vision to lead us on many strange and fabulous journeys in the years ahead.</p></p><p>Douglas E. Winter, author of <i>Stephen King: The Art of Darkness</i> and editor of two major dark-fiction anthologies (<i>Prime Evil</i> and <i>Revelations</i>), may be the reigning expert on modern horror. If his book <i>Clive Barker: The Dark Fantastic</i> is not the definitive biography of that polymathic author-playwright-auteur, it is only because the volume appeared when its subject was still in his late forties.<p> At 501 pages, plus 50 pages of endnotes and nearly 100 pages of Primary and Secondary Bibliography, <i>The Dark Fantastic</i> is an impressively thorough document. It covers Clive Barker's life from before birth (giving background on his parents, grandparents, and the hometown he shares with the Beatles) through the early years of struggle to his successes as an internationally bestselling author, Hollywood screenwriter-producer-director, and family man. The biography makes it clear that Barker has always had exceptional talent. (<i>The Dark Fantastic</i> includes, as an appendix, a previously unpublished story, written in Barker's early teens, "The Wood on the Hill." This uneven but fully developed fable of hubris is a tale authors twice as old would be proud to have written.)</p><p> Readers expecting a tell-all biography will be disappointed. A good portion of <i>The Dark Fantastic</i> is devoted to summaries and assessments of Barker's creations in many media. However, Winter's critical examinations are interesting, sympathetic, and honest. <i>The Dark Fantastic</i> is a must for all Barker fans and all serious scholars of horror and the fantastic. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p>Douglas E.

Barbellion described this remarkably candid record of living with multiple sclerosis as &#39;a study in the nude&#39;. It begins as an ambitious teenager&#39;s notes on the natural world, and then, following his diagnosis at the age of twenty-six, transforms into a deeply moving account of battling the disease. His prose is full of humour and fierce intelligence, and combines a passion for life with clear-sighted reflections on the nature of death. Barbellion selected and edited this manuscript himself in 1917, adding a fictional editor&#39;s note announcing his own demise. This Penguin Classics edition includes &#39;The Last Diary&#39;, which covers the period between submission of the manuscript and Barbellion&#39;s actual death in 1919.</p><p>W. N. P. Barbellion was the pseudonym of Bruce Frederick Cummings (1889-1919), an entomologist at the Natural History Museum in London. He selected W. N. P. as the initials of three of &#39;the most wretched figures in history&#39;: Kaiser Wilhelm, Emperor Nero and Pontius Pilate.

They try to come off rough-barked, but they're nothing but a bunch of lilies compared to men like Ian McCandles. <br><br>"I'll tell you something else about those cowboy pictures. They're clean, barely a smudge of dirt anywhere, but what happened out there in City of Rocks wasn't clean. It was grimy and smelly and gut-numbingly cold. Men died, and when they did they didn't just grab their chests and fall over. They got knocked down hard and the life spilled out of them like blood from a butchered hog. I guess I ought to know since I was there. Since it was me who did most of the killing that day."</p><p>Michael Zimmer is the author of twelve previous novels.

The forest was tight with heat, and sweat prickled on his skin.<br> The clearing around him was a blanket of root and stone, caged by silent trees and speckled by dark, leaf-spinning pools that hid the wriggling things of the soil. And at its heart, as though dropped by an ebbing tide, was the sacrifice box.<br><br> Mack was hopping in anticipation behind him. Arkle, Lamb, and Hadley stood on the other side of the box&#x2019;s stone, their sacrifices complete: a scatter of burned dragonflies, a little mirror, and a diary.<br><br> &#x201c;Sep,&#x201d; said Arkle, then louder: &#x201c;Sep!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing it,&#x201d; said Sep.<br><br> &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d; whispered Lamb.<br><br> Sep squeezed Barnaby. The little teddy&#x2019;s plastic snout was fixed in a smile, and his eyes were deep and brown.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; said Hadley.<br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; said Sep, turning his good ear toward her.<br><br> &#x201c;I said, are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br> He took a deep breath. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; said Hadley, lisping through her braces. Sep could hear the wheeze on the edge of her voice. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, he does,&#x201d; said Mack, chewing. &#x201c;We said we would. All of us. And it was his idea.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you eating another sandwich?&#x201d; said Arkle. &#x201c;Pac-Man with legs, you are.&#x201d;<br><br> Sep looked at Barnaby, at the matted fur and the pudgy limbs&#x2019; permanent star jump. The teddy was a ruined thing&#x2014;dragged through briar, thorn, and rain until his tummy split. Sep&#x2019;s mum had stitched him up with an old shoelace, the summer before she got sick.<br><br> As he thumbed the lace, Sep&#x2019;s good ear hissed with the treetops&#x2019; breeze&#x2014;then the wind died, and there was no sound but the pat and chuckle of the recent sun-shower as it dripped, leaf by leaf, down to the earth.<br><br> &#x201c;Sep, c&#x2019;mon&#x2014;&#x201d; said Arkle.<br><br> &#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d; said Lamb. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re interrupting his sacrifice!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sep!&#x201d; Arkle hissed again, even though people normally did what Lamb said since her mother died.<br><br> Sep sighed and looked up at Arkle&#x2019;s sweaty grin. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he said. The air was green and sticky, and dandelion seeds had stuck to their faces.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kneeling in poo,&#x201d; said Arkle. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just there. See? There?&#x201d;<br><br> Sep looked. &#x201c;Yes, thank you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;D&#x2019;you see it? It&#x2019;s brown.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Under your right knee.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my left knee,&#x201d; said Sep, wiping his jeans on the grass.<br><br> &#x201c;Same difference.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you putting the bear in or not?&#x201d; said Lamb.<br><br> Sep looked at tall, strong Lamb&#x2014;shoulders back, her mother&#x2019;s head scarf tied around the plaster cast on her wrist. She met his stare evenly, and he saw Arkle nod and Hadley smile, the trees behind them split by the recent lightning.<br><br> Barnaby had been a gift from his mum. Sep had tucked the bear beside her in the hospital bed, when she was sleeping after the operation&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d wondered, on the way home in his granda&#x2019;s car, whether her dying would mean he&#x2019;d get to stay on the mainland forever.<br><br> He&#x2019;d never forgotten the way the thought had felt in his head. Hot. And guilty.<br><br> He reached out to the box&#x2019;s cold stone, squeezed Barnaby one last time&#x2014;then tossed him after the other sacrifices and stepped toward the others.<br><br> &#x201c;Finally!&#x201d; said Arkle.<br><br> Mack raised his sacrifice.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re putting in your watch?&#x201d; said Lamb.<br><br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; said Mack, shrugging. &#x201c;There, I&#x2019;ve stopped the hands. It&#x2019;ll always show the time of this perfect moment, when we did this together.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter what you put in,&#x201d; said Arkle. &#x201c;Right? It&#x2019;s just a thing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It does so matter,&#x201d; said Sep. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing this for each other&#x2014;whatever you put in has to mean something.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All right, Seppy. So now what do we do?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Close it,&#x201d; said Sep.<br><br> Mack&#x2019;s dark brows furrowed low as he heaved on the box&#x2019;s stone lid. Sep looked for Barnaby, but the box was deep, and there was only darkness inside.<br><br> He thought about the broken wrist that had kept Lamb from hockey camp; the vacations that had isolated Hadley, Mack, and Arkle from their usual friends; the way they&#x2019;d bumped into one another on the beach; and how they&#x2019;d drifted into such perfect happiness over the last couple of weeks.<br><br> &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve loved this summer. I&#x2019;ve never really had anyone to, I mean&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> The lid slipped. Mack swore and snatched his hand away, gripping his fingers.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; said Hadley. &#x201c;Are you bleeding?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d; Mack flexed his fingers and swore again. Then he laughed. &#x201c;I think it bit me.&#x201d;<br><br> They stood back and looked at the sacrifice box. As the lid darkened in the rain it disappeared into the forest&#x2019;s skin, seeming like nothing more than a small, turf-sunk boulder. The world smelled bright and fresh and green.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s kind of amazing we found this,&#x201d; said Lamb.<br><br> &#x201c;It was the storm,&#x201d; said Sep, twisting his headphones. &#x201c;The box wasn&#x2019;t here last week. The rain must have washed it out.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How old do you think it is?&#x201d; said Hadley.<br><br> &#x201c;Hundreds of years. Maybe thousands.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe millions?&#x201d; said Arkle.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re an idiot,&#x201d; Lamb muttered, then flicked his ear.<br><br> Arkle grinned. &#x201c;I still think we should&#x2019;ve made it into a fire pit,&#x201d; he said, flipping the lid on his lighter up and down.<br><br> Sep saw Hadley watching him from under her fringe. Her tormentors, Sonya and Chantelle, had chased her to the forest and along the edge of the ravine, and her eyes were still red. He looked up through the trees at the clouds&#x2014;great towers of pearl that flattened to anvils on the sky and spread out over the island. The tide crashed onto the rocks, and he thought of his mum listening to the waves through the open window of the living room.<br><br> &#x201c;Now what?&#x201d; asked Arkle.<br><br> &#x201c;We say Sep&#x2019;s words,&#x201d; said Mack.<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not really mine,&#x201d; said Sep, remembering how the words had come to him, like a knife driven into his skull&#x2014;a waking dream so vivid he&#x2019;d cried out in the bright sunshine.<br><br> &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; said Lamb.<br><br> &#x201c;I kind of dreamed them. They&#x2019;re just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they&#x2019;re the box&#x2019;s rules.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All right, so we say them. Then what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll always be friends,&#x201d; said Sep.<br><br> &#x201c;How does that work?&#x201d; said Arkle.<br><br> &#x201c;Because we&#x2019;re making a promise to each other.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And it&#x2019;ll be our secret,&#x201d; said Hadley, gripping her inhaler. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t tell anyone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t think we should talk about this at school,&#x201d; said Arkle. &#x201c;I mean, it is kind of lame.&#x201d;<br><br> The rain started again, cold drops on their hot skin.<br><br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s say the words then,&#x201d; Sep said.<br><br> &#x201c;I call not standing next to you, poo-legs,&#x201d; said Arkle.<br><br> They arranged themselves around the box as the rain grew heavier, draping the clearing&#x2019;s edge in gray sheets and closing them in.<br><br> Sep tried to peer through it.<br><br> Something was moving in the shadows between the trees. He narrowed his eyes, focused on a shifting speck.<br><br> There was a sound like someone whispering&#x2014;or shouting from far away&#x2014;and a long moment hung in the clearing. Sep felt his skin crawl as he sensed other figures around the box, their shadows closing in.<br><br> Then Hadley said, &#x201c;Sep?&#x201d; and the moment lifted, and they were alone again.<br><br> Two crows spun through the rain. They settled on a branch high above them, shaking the drops from their feathers and shuffling their feet.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; said Sep.<br><br> Hadley took his hand in hers and lifted it over the box, joining their palms to the others&#x2019;. Sep felt how warm her skin was, caught her soft scent on the forest&#x2019;s breath, and closed his eyes.<br><br> &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; said Mack. &#x201c;Remember what to say?&#x201d;<br><br> Lamb nodded, her jaw muscles tight.<br><br> Something&#x2019;s really happening, Sep thought&#x2014;then Hadley squeezed his hand, and he forgot about everything that wasn&#x2019;t her.<br><br> &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Before Roxburgh finds us.&#x201d;<br><br> They spoke the words&#x2014;the rules of the sacrifice.<br><br><i> &#x201c;Never come to the box alone,&#x201d;</i> they said, hands unmoving.<br><br> <i>&#x201c;Never open it after dark,&#x201d;</i> they said, fingers joined together.<br><br> <i>&#x201c;Never take back your sacrifice,&#x201d;</i> they finished&#x2014;then let go.</p><h2>20 Ways to Draw a Chair and 44 Other Interesting Everyday Things: A Sketchbook for Artists, Designers, and Doodlers</h2><p><p><b>Create the perfect props and furnishings with this inspirational sketchbook that helps you doodle hundreds of simple, everyday items!</b></p><p>This inspiring sketchbook is part of the new <i>20 Ways</i> series from Quarry Books, designed to offer artists, designers, and doodlers a fun and sophisticated collection of illustration fun.

In this second book, he gives a telling of the Grail epic <i>Parzival.</i> Claiming it as a great trickster story of medieval Europe, he offers a deft and erudite commentary, with topics ranging from climate change and the soul to the discipline of erotic consciousness, from the hallucination of empire to a revisioning of the dark speech of the ancient bards. Ingrained in the very syntax of <i>Snowy Tower</i> is an invocation of what Shaw calls &#x2018;wild mythologies&#x2019; &#x2014; stories that are more than just human allegory, that seem to brush the winged thinking of owl, stream, and open moor. This daring work offers a connection to the genius of the margins; that the big questions of today will not be solved by big answers, but by the myriad of associations that both myth and wilderness offer.<br></p><p><b>Martin Shaw</b> leads a bustling schedule of lectures and workshops across Britain and the United States, and is principal teacher at Robert Bly&#x2019;s Great Mother Conference in Maine, and a contributor to the Dark Mountain Project in the U.K. Shaw has worked extensively and often collaboratively with Robert Bly, Coleman Barks, David Abram, Caroline Casey, and Malidoma Some. He is regarded internationally as one of most exciting new teachers of the mythic imagination. Bly describes him as a true master one of the very greatest storytellers we have.&#x201d; He lives in Devonshire, U.K.<br><br><b>Coleman Barks</b> is a renowned poet and the bestselling author of <i>The Essential Rumi</i>. He was prominently featured in both of Bill Moyers's PBS television series on poetry, "The Language of Life and Fooling with Words." He taught English and poetry at the University of Georgia for thirty years, and he now focuses on writing, readings, and performances.We hardly knew it, but we have been needing this story to return to us. It is one of the truly magnificent stories of our civilization. As you experience Martin Shaw&#x2019;s handling of the medieval epic Parzival, you enter the great myth of your own life. The great loves, the wound that won&#x2019;t heal, the lost brother we finally find, the grail that keeps leading us on. As a child, Parzival was called Beautiful Face&#x2019;, and you may find your own beautiful original face right here. This work is the wide-sky-waking of a spring dawn.<br><b>Coleman Barks, author of <i>The Essential Rumi</i></b><br><br>An outrageous piece of magic, this horde of galloping insights sprung from the meeting of one of Europe's most alchemical story traditions with the pirate brilliance of Martin Shaw. His rollicking telling of the Parzival legend makes obvious that Shaw is a master tale-slinger, but he's also a superb fisherman in the depths of our collective soul, reeling in wisdom that instructs, often disturbs and hugely nourishes.<br><br>He is on familiar terms with the language of magpies and the weaving techniques of spiders; whatever creaturely shape he takes, it&#x2019;s clear that he&#x2019;s drunk deep from rivers winding through many of the world&#x2019;s tangled cultures. Hence his tongue is steeped in tales within tales from traditions near and far. Reading this book we feel ourselves drying our boots 'round a crackling fire burning high in the mountains. The snow has finally stopped falling, lights from a village glimmer way off below, and someone&#x2019;s antlers are scraping the underside of the moon.<br><b>David Abram, author off <i>Becoming Animal</i> and <i>The Spell of the Sensuous</i></b><br><br>Martin Shaw has hung around a great deal in the Otherworld. There is woodsmoke and fox fur in his thinking, and a wild mix of courage, stories and troubling ideas - <i>Snowy Tower</i> is a kind of outlaw language.<br><b>Robert Bly, author of <i>Iron John</i></b><br><br>Martin Shaw's gift is his unsurpassed ability to bring myth and legend past locked gates and into our hearts. <i>Snowy Tower</i> reveals all the glory and terror of the human condition, showing us the deeper story of our own lives.<br><b>Jacob Needleman, author of <i>An Unknown World: Notes on the Meaning of the Earth</i></b><br><br>Martin Shaw's a conjurer, a 13th century troubadour dropped into our midst. <i>Snowy Tower</i> animates a tale from a far-off place and far-off time into vibrant, immediate life. He breathes into his characters a beating pulse, agile speech, and bedazzling wit. Catch him anyway you can.<br><b>Eric Utne, Founder, <i>Utne Reader</i></b><br><br>In <i>Snowy Tower</i> Martin Shaw gives us Parzival handled with an associative alacrity that yields new insight and a deeper connection to the story's cultural roots. Beyond the best thinking of individuals, here we find the best thinking of whole cultures. Shaw is a writer in love with the oral tradition. This is a rare voice opening a keen rapport with the wisdom of living myth.<br><b>Daniel Deardorff, author of <i>The Other Within</i></b></p><h2>Practice to Deceive</h2><p>St. Paul investigator Holland Taylor finds himself pursued by a hired killer when he tries to recover money for an elderly woman cheated out of her life savings and must untangle a complicated web involving prominent people and large investments</p><p>At first, reading about Holland Taylor might seem like d�j� vu. He's a former cop turned private detective; he has an African American associate who covers his back, a high-level friend on the police force, and a smart lady who tries to keep him on the straight path. He also practices martial arts, brews exotic coffee, and favors a special brand of local beer. But author David Housewright isn't doing a Spenser rip-off; he's just having fun telling a good story while ringing a few changes on Robert Parker. Taylor works out of Minnesota's Twin Cities, a long way from Spenser's Boston, and Housewright's plot is as open-faced as his genial homage. Asked by his father to help an 85-year-old neighbor recover the life savings stolen from her by an oily investment counselor, Taylor uses a cross-dressing computer genius to harass the swindler. Things quickly turn nasty and lots of shots are fired--some are deadly. Housewright's Edgar Award-winning first book about Taylor, <i>Penance</i>, is available in paperback.<p><strong>David Housewright </strong>has worked as a journalist covering both crime and sports (sometimes simultaneously), an advertising copywriter and creative director, and a writing instructor.

As we enter a world beyond paper, Ian Sansom explores the paradoxes of the greatest of man-made materials and shows how some kinds of paper, and the ghosts and shadows of paper, will always be with us.</p><p><em>Paper: An Elegy</em> is a history of paper in all its forms and functions.

Introd by R. Brognard Okie (158P)</h2><p>There have been a number of books published illustrating the early buildings in Pennsylvania. The authors of these books have not thought it worthwhile to show the smaller or more primitive houses or the barns and out-buildings that are so typical of Eastern Pennsylvania in particular, and that add so much to the attractiveness of the countryside. It should be rather humiliating to some of us who are so fond of the simple type of buildings but have done nothing to make a lasting record of them, that Miss Raymond (a Boston Architect) has stolen a march on us by putting in book form a record of interior and exterior views, not only of the smaller houses but of barns, mills, spring houses and other out-buildings which are fast disappearing from our countryside. Miss Raymond has done a real service in making a permanent record of these fine old buildings in such an instructive and interesting way. It is to be hoped that she has derived a proportion at least of the pleasure in her work the illustrations will give to others.</p><p></p><h2>Walkaway - Signed / Autographed Copy</h2><p>SIGNED BY THE AUTHOR, CORY DOCTOROW! Cory Doctorow&#39;s first adult novel in eight years: an epic tale of revolution, love, post-scarcity, and the end of death. Hubert Vernon Rudolph Clayton Irving Wilson Alva Anton Jeff Harley Timothy Curtis Cleveland Cecil Ollie Edmund Eli Wiley Marvin Ellis Espinoza known to his friends as Hubert, Etc was too old to be at that Communist party. But after watching the breakdown of modern society, he really has no where left to be except amongst the dregs of disaffected youth who party all night and heap scorn on the sheep they see on the morning commute. After falling in with Natalie, an ultra-rich heiress trying to escape the clutches of her repressive father, the two decide to give up fully on formal society and walk away. After all, now that anyone can design and print the basic necessities of life food, clothing, shelter from a computer, there seems to be little reason to toil within the system. It s still a dangerous world out there, the empty lands wrecked by climate change, dead cities hollowed out by industrial flight, shadows hiding predators animal and human alike. Still, when the initial pioneer walkaways flourish, more people join them. Then the walkaways discover the one thing the ultra-rich have never been able to buy: how to beat death. Now it s war a war that will turn the world upside down. Fascinating, moving, and darkly humorous, &#34;Walkaway&#34; is a multi-generation SF thriller about the wrenching changes of the next hundred years and the very human people who will live their consequences.</p><p></p><h2>The Coming Of the Glory</h2><p>From the back cover: Here are the &#34;Facts&#34; on Slavery, Secession and Reconstruction.

The reader will also be introduced to other writers, less well-known, but no less worthy. A tapestry woven of dazzling language and imagination.</p><p>The Irish have always had a way with words. Long ago they took on a language not their own and learned to re-word it into pure magic. Nowhere is this magic more in evidence than in their short stories?stories that combine lyricism, humor and tragedy with rare imagination set in simple backgrounds, largely without props. <br>The seemingly effortless art of the best Irish writers has an appeal that is naive and highly sophisticated at the same time; the disarming simplicity with which the tales are spun being somewhat misleading at first reading. <br>In this anthology there are gathered, for the first time in America, some of the more representative examples of Irish short fiction. The emphasis is on variety. All are a delight to read. All have universal appeal. Only 21 of the 44 have previously been published in this country.</p><h2>BITTY GOES TO SCHOOL (Pictureback Shapes)</h2><p>A kitten looks forward her first day of school, but when it arrives, she has some adjusting to do.</p><p></p><h2>The Big Bang Never Happened: A Startling Refutation of the Dominant Theory of the Origin of the Universe</h2><p>A mesmerizing challenge to orthodox cosmology with powerful implications not only for cosmology itself but also for our notions of time, God, and human nature -- with a new Preface addressing the latest developments in the field.<br><br>Far-ranging and provocative, The Big Bang Never Happened is more than a critique of one of the primary theories of astronomy -- that the universe appeared out of nothingness in a single cataclysmic explosion ten to twenty billion years ago. Drawing on new discoveries in particle physics and thermodynamics as well as on readings in history and philosophy, Eric J. Lerner confronts the values behind the Big Bang theory: the belief that mathematical formulae are superior to empirical observation; that the universe is finite and decaying; and that it could only come into being through some outside force. With inspiring boldness and scientific rigor, he offers a brilliantly orchestrated argument that generates explosive intellectual debate.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>&#34;Lerner does a fine job poking holes in Big Bang thinking and provides a historical perspective as well, linking scientific theories to trends in philosophy, politics, religion and even economics...a most readable book.&#34; -- Chicago TribuneReaders inspired by Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time should brace themselves for Lerner's larger history of time, space and a new force: the humanistic sociology of science. The timely news (making headlines as this review goes to press) is that the Big Bang cosmology can no longer contain all the new evidence astronomers have gathered about the physical nature of the universe. In fact, Lerner argues, the persistence of the Big Bang and other finite definitions of the universe is rooted less in data gathered by radio telescopes than in medieval devotion to the idea of the finite, perfectly ordered universe. Lerner calibrates the Big Bang's development as one of the swings of the "cosmological pendulum" of science in history--from the perfect, mathematically closed systems of early Christian cosmos to the scientific revolution of the 19th century, back to today's "Theory of Everything" in particle physics. Lerner's own cosmology is plasma-based, an incomplete physics that includes electromagnetism as well as Einstein's gravity principles at work in the creation of one of an ever-expanding universe, which requires neither creator nor "bang," and is still evolving with humankind. Lay readers will need familiarity with the basics of quantum theory or a science dictionary to fully appreciate this grand tour of three centuries of cosmology, but this is an expedition of the scientific mind that includes all the grandeur, rigor and challenge to our humanity that has marked cosmology since Galileo. Plasma physicist Lerner holds open the door to one of science's inner rooms for a popular audience.

Original.</p><p>P.J. Parrish is the New York Times bestselling author of ten Louis Kincaid and Joe Frye thrillers. The author is actually two sisters, Kristy Montee and Kelly Nichols. Their books have appeared on both the New York Times and USA Today best seller lists. The series has garnered 11 major crime-fiction awards, and an Edgar� nomination. Parrish has won two Shamus awards, one Anthony and one International Thriller competition. Her books have been published throughout Europe and Asia.A missing child and a truly vicious family of killers make for a brisk race against time in Parrish's latest adventure featuring Florida detective Louis Kincaid (<i>Island of Bones</i>, etc.). Kincaid has just begun to connect romantically with defense attorney Susan Outlaw when her estranged husband, Austin, a globe-trotting businessman of shady ways and means, arrives at her doorstep, wanting time with son Ben. Father and son head off for ice cream, but don't return. Louis follows their trail, which leads back to Austin's office, where police have just discovered the brutally murdered bodies of Austin's partner and secretary. Austin later lands in Louis's custody but Ben remains missing. Austin eventually reveals his botched role in a transaction to purchase Micronesian women as slaves. This lean, fast-paced yarn takes a rather silly final turn, when the ruthless patriarch behind the whole mess, and his motives, are revealed (the slaves weren't used for work or sex but for hunting prey, � la John Saul's <i>Manhattan Hunt Club</i>). This might have constituted a dandy surprise ending had the back jacket copy not given it away; as it stands, it feels like an afterthought in an otherwise worthwhile thriller. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Seventy-five million years later, scientists discovered the Ornithomimus&#39; well-hidden, complete articulated skeleton in the badlands of Alberta&#39;s Dinosaur Provincial Park -- conclusive evidence that this little-studied family of dinosaurs is closely related to modern birds.</p><p>Grade 5-9-Using the resources of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta, the author focuses on one particular ornithomimid-an Ornithomimus edmontonensis-whose articulated fossilized remains were found in the rich beds of Canada's Dinosaur Provincial Park in 1995. Interspersed with episodes of a fictional biography of the ornithomimus in question (based on current knowledge/theories), the body of the book covers a vast amount of information on the discovery, excavation, and preservation of this extraordinarily complete specimen, and its subsequent display in the museum galleries. Keiran discusses the importance of fossilized plants and pollen in scientific research, continental drift, feathered dinosaurs, and the evolution of physical characteristics such as beaks and hollow bones. Color photos, small drawings, and an evolutionary "tree" are included, as well as a strong glossary and biographical sketches of several of the scientists and technicians involved with this important fossil. A location map and an index are sadly missing. The readable and engaging text contains a number of British spellings. Some readers may follow the fictional "Bird Mimic Chronicles" with their colorful, realistic oil paintings before settling down to the detailed examination of this exceptional find, while others may ignore them completely, looking only for present-day realities. A handsome, informative addition to a highly popular field.<br><i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4-6. Mingling descriptions of paleontology in the field with analyses of findings and speculative reconstructions of prehistoric events, Keiran reports on two recent discoveries in Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada: a nearly complete fossil of an avian ancestor and a bed of fossilized plant matter. The former gets the most attention. Unlike related specimens found in China, the fossil has no feather impressions, but the skull does bear remnants of a beak. Numerous small, fanciful drawings of theropods engaged in such activities as holding up a picture frame for a "family portrait" merely fill up space, but the array of color paintings and photos adds significant detail to the field reports, and also to the discussion of the animal's structural similarities to modern birds. Christopher Sloan's <i>Feathered Dinosaurs</i> (2000) is a broader and more dramatically illustrated overview of what we know about these avian progenitors, but as a specific case study, this makes an appealing addition to the dinosaur shelves. <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The book also focuses on the roles of Congress, the Supreme Court, and outside players in the national security process like the media, think tanks, and lobbyists.

The B-29 remained in service in various roles throughout the 1950s. The British Royal Air Force flew the B-29 and used the name Washington for the type, and the Soviet Union produced an unlicensed copy as the Tupolev Tu-4. The name "Superfortress" was derived from that of its well-known predecessor, the B-17 Flying Fortress. The B-29 was the progenitor of a series of Boeing-built bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, trainers and tankers including the variant, B-50 Superfortress.<br><br>The B-29 was one of the largest aircraft to see service during World War Two. A very advanced bomber for its time, it included features such as pressurized cabins, an electronic fire-control system and remote-controlled machine-gun turrets. Though it was designed as a high-altitude daytime bomber, in practice it actually flew more low-altitude nighttime incendiary bombing missions. It was the primary aircraft in the American firebombing campaign against Japan in the final months of World War Two, and carried the atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Unlike many other World War Two-era bombers, the B-29 remained in service long after the war ended, with a few even being employed as flying television transmitters. The type was finally retired in the early 1960s, with 3,960 aircraft in all built.<br><br>Without doubt there is a clear, strong requirement to &#x2018;put the record straight&#x2019; using primary source documentation to record the undoubted achievements alongside and in context with the shortcomings to the type&#x2019;s design and operation that have otherwise received scant attention.<br><br>The book will cover all variants and is profusely illustrated.</p><p>English professional aviation writer, publisher and historian Graham M Simons is one of the founders of the world famous aviation museum at Duxford near Cambridge where his interest was piqued watching the making of the &#x2018;Battle of Britain&#x2019; film there in the late 1960&#x2019;s and from the days when you could go &#x2018;aircraft spotting&#x2019; at London Heathrow and other airports.</p><h2>Carmen Dog (Peapod Classics)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Combines the cruel humor of <i>Candide</i> with the allegorical panache of <i>Animal Farm.</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p>"Carol is the most unappreciated great writer we've got. <i>Carmen Dog</i> ought to be a classic in the colleges by now . . .

B. White was the most graceful of writers. A generation of imitators tried, but seldom succeeded, to match his casual self-assurance. We like to imagine White on his New England farm dashing off lighthearted essays and charming books for children when he wasn't slopping hogs or chopping wood. In fact, White worried over every word. He rewrote pieces twenty times or more and sometimes pleaded with the postmaster of North Brooklin, Maine, to return a just-mailed manuscript so he could punch up its ending or rewrite the lead.In addition to being a consummate rewriter, White was a gifted procrastinator. By writing long letters and puttering about his farm, he often managed to avoid the trauma of writing altogether. When the <i>Paris Review</i> wanted to interview him for its <i>Writers at Work</i> series, White said he'd be better qualified for one on <i>Writers</i> Not <i>at Work.</i> White later toldhis friend James Thurber that he considered himself "the second most inactive writer living, and the third most discouraged."This would have surprised readers of his essays. To them, E. B. White was a courageous interpreter of the world's vagaries. That wasn't how he saw himself. After the president of Dartmouth College paid tribute to his "literary bravery," White thought, "He little knew." Dartmouth's president made that remark while conferring an honorary degree on the nation's favorite essayist. This was a rare occasion in which White had been lured from his farm onto a public platform. As he sat there, White later wrote his wife, "the old emptiness and dizziness and vapors seized hold of me ... . Nobody who has never suffered my peculiar kind of disability can understand the sheer hell of such moments."Elwyn Brooks White had a lifelong fear of making public appearances. In his elementary school, students were called on to recite in alphabetical order of their last names. White spent long, agonizing hours dreading his fate as classmates whose names began with the alphabet's first twenty-two letters strode to the front of the room. Recitation wasn't his only childhood fear. Other things that scared White included darkness, girls, lavatories, the future, and the "fear that I was unknowing about things I should know about." Although he outgrew some of these anxieties, others took their place. White's fear of school bathrooms was replaced by concern that the brakes would fail on a trolley taking him up or down a hill. When he no longer needed to fret about reciting in class, White worried about collapsing on the street. By adding and subtracting fears this way, he kept himself in a steady state of anxiety. "Much of the story of the life of E. B. White,"wrote biographer Scott Elledge, "is the story of how he has come to terms with his fears."The most effective strategy of all was to turn them into stories. White's books for children conveyed a tone of apprehension with the sure voice of an expert. Stuart Little found Manhattan no less frightening than his creator did. Wilbur the pig, in <i>Charlotte's Web,</i> was as scared of dying as his literary parent (though with more justification). The best of White's work had an edgy flavor that <i>demanded</i> readers pay attention. Joseph Epstein has pointed out the many anxious, almost macabre elements in White's deceptively "light" essays: a henhouse consumed with "contagious hysteria and fear"; "faces desperate in the rain"; "the fierce bewildering night." One of E. B. White's best essays--"The Second Tree from the Corner"--describes a Whitelike man named Trexler who consults a psychiatrist about his crippling anxieties. Unable to answer the psychiatrist's questions, Trexler nonetheless leaves his office feeling unburdened, "unembarrassed at being afraid; and in the jungle of his fear he glimpsed (as he had so often glimpsed them before) the flashy tail feathers of the bird courage."White personified courage by being so willing to sail boldly into the squall of his own fears, commenting on the trip as he went. That's why we took to him. This man seemed at least as anxious as we were, but more willing to own up to it. "I am not inclined to apologize for my anxieties," he once said, "because I have lived with them long enough to respect them." When it came to his calling, White wrote eloquently about how much courage it took to write. "A writer's courage can easily fail him," he observed while accepting the National Medal for Literature. "I feel this daily."In his simplest testament of all, White said, "I admire anybody who has the guts to write anything at all."<i>A Dangerous Career</i>The saga of E. B. White tells us something about writing fears and the courage to write. On the one hand, anxiety is inevitable among those who put words on paper for others to read. On the other hand, fear can be transcended, can even be made part of the writing process itself. Doing this takes courage. Few authors would dispute that. In talking with writers on this subject and reading about them, I discovered that their attitude differs little from E. B. White's. John Cheever called the attempt to write seriously "quite a dangerous career." Katherine Anne Porter thought that for writers, courage was "the first essential."Before I began writing for a living, it hadn't occurred to me that courage was part of the job description. I knew this calling took skill, imagination, and persistence, and hoped I had these qualities. By working at a newspaper I'd learned some basics of my craft. With savings and a few contacts among editors, I set out to be a freelance writer. I outfitted myself with a thesaurus, a style manual, and a brand-new Smith-Corona typewriter. Now it was just a matter of getting down to business. Or so I thought.Only after my tenth sleepless night did it dawn on me that there might be more to this business than recording good words on paper. By the time I started my first book, there was no escaping the fact that anxiety had elbowed its way into my office to sit beside me, scrutinizing every word I wrote. Much of this anxiety showed up in disguise. It expressed itself as stomach trouble, irritability, and restlessness. Duringtoss-and-turn nights I'd jot notes on a pad beside my bed. (Like marijuana-inspired brilliance, such notes were seldom of any use in the light of day.) Seven-day workweeks became routine as I tried to build walls of research and rhetoric strong enough to protect me from marauding critics. When a friend offered me a relaxing massage to ease my obvious tension, I turned the offer down out of fear that getting too relaxed might keep me from finishing my book. I had trouble even <i>thinking</i> about anything other than getting the book done. Taking a weekend off or even spending an evening with friends might break the writing spell forever, I feared. Then I might never return to my desk. I would be revealed as an impostor: someone who said he could write a book but couldn't.I did finish that book (<i>We, the Lonely People: Searching for Community</i>) but doubted I'd do another. Why endure such trauma again? Yet within the year I was writing a second book, and three years later, a third. I've now been through this process eight times. Along the way, I've learned three things. One is that I'll survive; finish the book and live to write another. Second, I'll regain my sanity (such as it is). Finally, I've learned that a rising tide of anxiety isn't necessarily bad. It's a sign that I'm getting serious. Nervousness keeps me alert. Fear forces me to focus and to work longer hours. Restless nights mean I'm gaining momentum. The end is in sight. Getting there isn't always pleasant. Neither is running in a marathon. Or staging a play. Or climbing a mountain. All such activities take courage. And all reward those who complete them not only with an unparalleled feeling of achievement but with a thrilling sense of adventure along the way.Writers sometimes compare themselves to explorers. John Ashbery said that for him, the excitement of writing poetrylay in going to new places. "Voyages of exploration," is what Malcolm Cowley called novel writing. Any writing worth doing is a trek into the unknown. Writers never know where their pen or keyboard will take them. "You go in with a certain fear and trembling," said James Baldwin of writing books. "You know one thing. You know you will not be the same person when this voyage is over. But you don't know what's going to happen to you between getting on the boat and stepping off."The longer I write, the more my admiration has grown for those who set out on this journey. They are apprehensive and should be. Writing is a daring act. Any time we put so much as a word on paper we're in jeopardy. (What if someone thinks we could have chosen a better one?) Whoever writes for public scrutiny is subject to a form of what psychologists call "performance anxiety." Polls routinely confirm that public speaking is our number-one fear. (Dying ranks sixth, according to one such poll.) Writing is merely public speaking on paper, but to a much larger audience. For some, writing to publish is even more daunting than speaking in public. Spoken words blow away in the wind. Published ones last as long as the paper on which they're printed.A psychologist I know named Brian makes a good living giving lectures. In the world of public speakers, writing a book is considered a first-rate marketing tool. An author who speaks has far more panache than a speaker alone. Brian knows this. He wants desperately to write a book, and not just as a marketing tool. There are things Brian has to say that he'd like people to read: about the environment, family issues, and social ethics. So far he hasn't been able to put them on paper. This man can electrify thousands of listeners when he gives a keynote address. He does so dozens of times a year.But whenever Brian approaches a typewriter, his fingers rebel. They refuse to convey messages from his brain to the paper.Brian has lots of company. The trail of literary history is littered with those who fell along the way because the anxiety of trying to write paralyzed their hand. Many nonwriting writers are gifted. The best writers I know teach school and sell real estate. Some still plan to write "someday." Others have given up altogether. Their block lies not with their ability or skill but with their nerve."You need a certain amount of nerve to be a writer," said Margaret Atwood, "an almost physical nerve, the kind you need to walk a log across a river." Few of her colleagues would disagree. Yet too many writers think it's their shameful little secret that they're scared. That's simply not so. Fear is felt by writers at every level. Anxiety accompanies the first word they put on paper and the last. "I write in terror," admitted Cynthia Ozick. "I have to talk myself into bravery with every sentence, sometimes every syllable."Its psychic demands make writing an exercise in courage little different from climbing a sheer granite cliff or skiing down a steep slope. This often surprises new writers. No literary neophyte doubts that hard work lies ahead. Most realize that certain skills must be mastered to compose a coherent text. They hope their intellectual gifts will allow them to produce work of substance. The real shock is discovering how demanding writing is not just of their skill, talent, and work ethic but of their valor.<i>The Great Unspoken</i>My friend Cal recently completed a short story. Cal had taken a writing class, gotten tutoring from his teacher, and joined awriters' group. More important, he wrote. The results were promising. I've read worse stories in print. Would he try to get his published? Cal said he was thinking about it. He'd gone so far as to collect the names of magazines but hadn't sent his story to any of them.Why not? I asked."I'm too scared."During a quarter century as a writer and teacher of writing, I've heard hundreds of variations on this theme. An inability to write, finish a piece of writing, or put completed writing in the mail is routine among those who want to see their words in print. If they realized that all writers are anxious--but that writing fears are predictable and manageable--perhaps more discouraged writers would be writing today. Although crippling anxieties are as much a part of the writing process as punctuation, they also are a Great Unspoken.The huge database Nexis has only twelve references to <i>writing anxiety.</i> By contrast, Nexis has well over a thousand citations for the term <i>writer's block.</i> There's a reason for this. Calling an inability to write a "block" suggests there's just some obstruction down the line that can be cleared with a literary Roto-Rooter. According to one school of thought, writing blocks are due primarily to faulty technique. In other words, blocked writers simply haven't learned their literary lessons. That's a promising premise. The notion that writing problems can be solved by learning how to choose better words and move more smoothly from one paragraph to the next is reassuring. "One more course and I'll be writing away."But writing problems aren't that easily solved. Few result from ignorance alone. Most writers know the basics of theircraft: show, don't tell; use active verbs; be sparing with adjectives and adverbs; make effective use of detail. It's important to learn and relearn these lessons. Yet there's a limit to how much mastering writing rules can do to improve prose or poetry. In the long run, learning techniques does far less to improve our writing than finding the will, the nerve, the <i>guts</i> to put on paper what we really want to say.Unfortunately, there is not much help available to do this. Most writing courses and books only strike fear a glancing blow. They rarely address the crippling inhibitions that keep even gifted writers from getting material out of their head, onto paper, and into the mail. According to Bonnie Friedman, a graduate of the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, her seminars there dealt with words on the page but not how to find them. Among the key questions she and her fellow students never asked were: How to write despite fear? Where to find courage? <i>"Courage</i> is from the word for heart," said Friedman in her book, <i>Writing Past Dark.</i> "School had little to do with heart, and everything to do with technical perfection."Even programs and books that do acknowledge how daunting writing can be usually advise anxious writers to just roll up their sleeves, sharpen their pencils, and get busy. The obvious advice for anyone intimidated by writing fears is: "Don't be scared. What are you afraid of? Just do it!" Such exhortations are offered most freely by those who aren't up on the high wire themselves (i.e., teachers, editors, critics). But there are genuine, serious, and understandable reasons to be anxious about writing. Advising writers to ignore their anxiety and forge ahead is like telling a ten-year-old who's about to get a shot, "There's nothing to be scared of." That kid knows better. So do writers.When I lecture on writing fears, listeners usually sit up straight and pay close attention. This has nothing to do with my speaking ability and everything to do with their personal stake in this t...</p><h2>Natural Tucker Bread Book</h2><p>This book features sourdough, yeasted and unleavened breads.

Since trauma was her specialty, she had certainly seen her share of mangled and brutalized bodies. It was her responsibility to put them back together, and as a senior fellow, she had the added duty of training the first &#x2013; and second-year residents.<br>St. Vincent&#x2019;s emergency room had been full since 4:00 A.M. that morning, and Ellie was finishing what she hoped was her last surgery of the day, a repair of a splenic rupture. A teenager, barely old enough to have a driver&#x2019;s license, had decided to test the limits of the speedometer in his parents&#x2019; Camry and had lost control, rolling the car over an embankment and landing upside down in an open field. Lucky for him, he had been wearing a seat belt, and luckier still, a man following some distance behind him had seen the whole thing and was able to call for an ambulance immediately. The boy made it to the emergency room just in time.<br>Ellie was observed by three second-year surgical residents, who hung on her every word. She was a natural teacher and, unlike 90 percent of the surgeons on staff at St. Vincent&#x2019;s Hospital, didn&#x2019;t have much of an ego. She was amazingly patient with the medical students and residents. While she worked, she explained&#x2014;and explained again&#x2014;until they finally understood what she was doing and why. No question was deemed too insignificant or foolish, which was one of the many reasons they idolized her, and for the male residents, the fact that she was drop-dead gorgeous didn&#x2019;t hurt. Because she was such a talented surgeon and supportive teacher, all these fledgling doctors fought to sign up for her rotation. Ironically, what they didn&#x2019;t know was that she was younger than most of them.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re off duty this weekend, aren&#x2019;t you, Ellie?&#x201d;<br>Ellie glanced over at Dr. Kevin Andrews, the anesthesiologist, who had asked the question. He had joined the staff six months before and, since the day he&#x2019;d met Ellie, had been hounding her to go out with him. He was an outrageous flirt and yet very sweet. Blond hair, blue eyes, tall and well built with an adorable smile, he could turn the head of almost every woman in the hospital, but for Ellie there just wasn&#x2019;t any spark.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I am. I have the whole weekend off,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Charlie, would you like to close up for me?&#x201d; she asked one of the hovering residents.<br>&#x201c;Absolutely, Dr. Sullivan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You better hurry,&#x201d; Andrews said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waking him up.&#x201d;<br>The resident looked panic-stricken.<br>&#x201c;Take your time, Charlie. He&#x2019;s just messing with you,&#x201d; she said, a smile in her voice.<br>&#x201c;Tuesday&#x2019;s your last day at St. Vincent&#x2019;s, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Andrews asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Tuesday&#x2019;s my last official day. I might help out on a temporary basis later on, but I&#x2019;m not promising anything yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then you could decide to come back permanently.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t reply.<br>He persisted. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll give you anything you want. You could name your price, your hours . . . you should stay here, Ellie. You belong here.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t agree or disagree. In truth, she didn&#x2019;t know where she belonged. It had been such a hard road to get this far, she hadn&#x2019;t had time to think about the future. At least that was the excuse she used for her indecision.<br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; she finally conceded. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201d;<br>She stood over Charlie, watching like a mother hen. &#x201c;I want those stitches tight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Dr. Sullivan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So Monday night is my last chance to take you to heaven?&#x201d; Andrews asked in a teasing drawl.<br>She laughed. &#x201c;Heaven? Last week you were going to rock my world. Now you&#x2019;re going to take me to heaven?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I guarantee it. I&#x2019;ve got testimonials if you want to see them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going to happen, Kevin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not giving up.&#x201d;<br>She sighed. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>As she checked the last suture, she rolled her shoulders and stretched her neck to one side then the other to get the kinks out. She&#x2019;d been in the OR since 5:00 A.M., which meant she had been bent over patients for eleven hours. Sad to say, that wasn&#x2019;t a record for her.<br>She felt wrung out and stiff and sore. A good run around the park would get those muscles moving, she decided, maybe even rev up her energy.<br>&#x201c;You know what would help you get rid of a stiff neck?&#x201d; Andrews said.<br>&#x201c;Let me guess. A trip to heaven?&#x201d;<br>One of the nurses snorted with laughter. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s awfully persistent, Dr. Sullivan. Maybe you should give in.&#x201d;<br>Ellie removed her gloves and dropped them in the trash bag by the OR doors. &#x201c;Thanks, Megan, but I think I&#x2019;ll just go for a run instead.&#x201d; As she pushed the doors wide, she untied her surgical mask and pulled off her cap, shaking her blond hair loose to fall to her shoulders.<br>Twenty minutes later she was officially off duty. She changed into her workout clothes, a pair of faded red shorts and a white tank top. She double-tied her beat-up running shoes, grabbed a rubber band and swept her hair up in a ponytail, slipped her iPod into one pocket and her cell phone into the other, and she was ready. Walking a maze of corridors to get outside, she avoided the direct route through the ER for fear she&#x2019;d get waylaid with another case.<br>There was never a lack of patients rolling through the doors. Along with the usual emergencies&#x2014;the car accidents, the heart attacks, the work injuries&#x2014;the ER saw a steady stream of victims of violent crimes. The vast majority were young men. Gangs roamed the area east of the highway, and shooting one another seemed to be a nightly sport. Since St. Vincent&#x2019;s was the largest trauma center in St. Louis, all the serious cases came to them. Weekends were a nightmare for the staff. There were times, especially during the hot summer months, when gurneys lined the halls of the ER with patients handcuffed to the railings while they waited to go into surgery. Additional police had to be routinely called in to monitor them to make certain one gang member hadn&#x2019;t been placed too close to a rival.<br>Ellie became a member of the One Hundred Club when she removed her one hundredth bullet. It wasn&#x2019;t a club she wanted to join, but she would always remember the case. The young man was only twenty years old, and it was the third time he&#x2019;d been shot. She couldn&#x2019;t forget his insolence and his cold, empty eyes. They were almost as lifeless as the cadavers down in the morgue. Patching up these boys so that they could return to the streets and the same violence was heart wrenching, and she prayed, with every surgery, that this time they would learn something, that this time they would find a new life. It was a naive hope, but she clung to it anyway.<br>Like the other overworked and underpaid residents and fellows, Ellie operated on broken bodies, the consequence of violence. But she had never actually witnessed a crime . . . until today.<br>It was a hot and humid late afternoon. Two medical students had caught up with Ellie just as she began her run on the onemile track in Cambridge Park, a vast area that sat adjacent to the hospital. Heavy rain clouds hung over them, and all three panted for air. After the first mile, both students dropped out, but Ellie was determined to get in at least one more mile before calling it quits. She made mental lists as she ran. She had a million things to do before heading home to Winston Falls.<br>Dear God, it was muggy. The humidity was so thick, she felt as though she were running through a sauna. Sweat trickled down the back of her neck, and her drenched clothes clung to her body. Her friend Jennifer, a nurse in pediatrics, who was taking a shortcut across the track to get to the ER entrance, shouted to Ellie that she was crazy to run in this heat. Ellie waved and continued on. She probably was crazy, but getting any time to work out was such a luxury, she couldn&#x2019;t afford to be choosy about the weather.<br>Ellie could hear faint cheering coming from the new soccer field across the street to the north, and as she rounded the curve, she saw the players&#x2014;high school &#x2013; age girls&#x2014;sprinting across the field. From the large number of fans in the bleachers, she guessed it was an important game.<br>The administrator of the hospital, the board, and a plethora of attorneys had fought the soccer field. They wanted to purchase the land to build another huge parking garage, and Ellie was happy they had lost their bid. Like the track and small playground to the south, the soccer field was far enough away from the hospital that, no matter how much noise the teams and fans made, the patients weren&#x2019;t disturbed.<br>Ellie was a football, basketball, and soccer fan, in that order. She loved to watch most sporting events. She admired the grace, skill, and finesse of the players, probably because she didn&#x2019;t possess any of those attributes herself. She had been such an awkward child, her mother had enrolled her in ballet classes, and she never got to play a sport. When she wasn&#x2019;t tripping over her own feet trying to do a pli�, she was reading. She was much more comfortable with her books. Her aunt Vivien liked to call her a bookworm.<br>No time to watch any games today, she thought. She had way too much to do. She returned to her mental list of things to be accomplished before she could head home to her sister&#x2019;s wedding. Oh God, how she dreaded that. She wished she had another week to get ready for the ordeal; then admitted to herself that no amount of time would prepare her for the whispers and the sympathetic smiles from her friends and family. Who could blame them? After all, her sister Ava was marrying Ellie&#x2019;s ex-fianc�. It was going to be a week of mortification, she decided. But, hey, she was tough. She could handle it.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; she whispered.<br>And then there was Evan Patterson. Just thinking about him made her stomach hurt. Would he dare show up in Winston Falls? God, she hoped not. But if he did, would she need to get another restraining order, even if she was going to be home for only a few days? She could feel herself getting worked up and had to force herself to calm down. She was an adult now, and she could handle anything that came her way. Even a maniac, she told herself. Besides, she was sure Evan wasn&#x2019;t back in Winston Falls. If he had returned, her father would have alerted her.<br>Ellie didn&#x2019;t want to worry about Patterson now or think about the wedding. Instead, she chose to focus on the task at hand. Just a little more than a half mile to go, then a lovely cold shower. She took her earphones from her pocket and was about to turn on her iPod to listen to a lecture on new thoracotomy procedures when she heard a loud pop.<br>Ellie stopped running. Lightning? She looked up at the ominous sky just as another pop echoed, then a third and a fourth in rapid succession. Had lightning hit a transformer? That would explain the bursts . . . except there hadn&#x2019;t been any lightning.<br>Gunshots? Had to be. As many bullets as Ellie had removed from gunshot victims, she&#x2019;d never actually heard the sound of a gun firing. The noise came from somewhere up ahead. She glanced to the right toward the soccer field. No panic there. The game was still going on, so she had to be wrong. If not gunshots . . . then what?<br>Five or six seconds had passed since the first popping sound. Ellie reached for her earphones again. Okay, she&#x2019;d been mistaken.<br>Then the screaming started.<br>Everything happened so fast. In the span of just a few more seconds, Ellie observed the chaotic scene unfold in front of her as though it were happening in slow motion.<br>In the distance, several men, wearing navy blue T-shirts and vests with FBI in bold yellow letters printed on the back, appeared almost out of nowhere and fanned out as they raced toward the trees in the center of the park. People were scattering every which way. Screams mingled with the cheers from the soccer field, the fans and players apparently oblivious to what was happening. A father ran from the playground toward the street with two little boys. The children weren&#x2019;t able to keep up, so the father scooped them into his arms and kept running. Several people who had been strolling through the park also scrambled to get away, as did three boys who had been tossing a Frisbee. One of the boys ran into the street, directly in front of an ambulance returning to the hospital. The vehicle came to a screeching halt, and the boy rushed around to the open window shouting something to the paramedic as he pointed toward the trees.<br>Suddenly, a man and a woman, linked arm in arm, drew her attention. They walked briskly toward her on the running path. There was something off about both of them. The man had a thick mustache. He wore dark glasses, a baseball cap pulled down over his forehead, and a brown, hooded windbreaker zipped up to his neck, a peculiar choice in the 90-degree weather. Was he all bundled up to keep his clothes dry when the storm broke? The man looked over his shoulder, his neck glistening with sweat. The woman looked directly at Ellie. Her bizarre appearance was startling. A short black wig sat slightly askew on her head with a few long hairs hanging down the side of her neck. Her eyes were such an intense, unnatural shade of green, she looked as though she were wearing novelty contacts, the ones you&#x2019;d buy for a Halloween party. When the couple was about thirty feet away from Ellie, they veered toward the street.<br>Someone shouted a command. Then one of the FBI agents who had run into the trees appeared and headed straight for the pair. The woman let go of the man and began to run as he slowed and pulled something from his coat pocket. When he whirled around to face the agent shouting at him, Ellie saw the gun. Before she could react, he&#x2019;d fired two shots. The first bullet struck the man in pursuit, the force so great it knocked him back before he crashed to the ground. The second bullet went wild. As Ellie dived to the grass, the shooter spun around and pointed the gun toward her. He didn&#x2019;t pull the trigger but instead ran to the street and jumped into a car that sped away.<br>The ambulance had just turned around to go in the direction the boys were pointing, but when the gunshots were fired, it changed course. Sirens on, the ambulance crossed over the curb and swerved to miss the hospital emergency entrance sign. It bounded across the park toward the gunshot victim, weaving in and out of the crowd that was scrambling toward the boulevard.<br>Ellie jumped to her feet and ran after it. Her mind was racing. Who were the surgeons on call tonight? Edmonds and Walmer, she remembered, and she&#x2019;d seen both of them in the hospital. Good.<br>The target had been a good distance away from the shooter, but he&#x2019;d taken a direct hit to the torso. Ellie had no idea how bad the wound was, but she thought, if she could stabilize him, he&#x2019;d make it to the OR.<br>The ambulance crossed the grassy area of the park in...</p></p><h2>Easy Guide to the Dragon</h2><p>The Dragon is in many ways the most logical way for Black to play the Sicilian.

In fact she wrote it when she was twenty-seven and had just been made redundant from her job as a secretary. Inspired by Nick Hornby&#39;s High Fidelity, a book about young people just like her who lived in London, she wrote the first three chapters of what was to become her first novel, Ralph&#39;s Party. It went on to become the bestselling debut novel of 1998. Fifteen bestselling novels later, she lives in London with her husband and their two daughters. Lisa writes every day in a local cafe where she can drink coffee, people-watch and, without access to the internet, actually get some work done . . . Keep in touch with Lisa: www.lisa-jewell.co.uk www.facebook.com/LisaJewellOfficial @lisajewelluk on Twitter<p> <b> <b>Prologue</b> </b> </p><p>The twelfth anniversary of Ralph and Jem&#x2019;s first kiss falls upon a cool, paper-dry Wednesday at the beginning of March. The wisteria outside Jem&#x2019;s office window has yet to yield its cascades of perfumed lilac blooms and the hydrangea by the front door is stubby and only just turning green&#x2014;spring feels a long way off although it is just round the corner. </p><p>At about three fifteen, Jem leaves her office, heading for an appointment in Battersea. She takes with her a small manila folder, her mobile phone, her handbag and a loaf of brown bread. Before she leaves she turns to her assistant, Mariel, who is making tea in the kitchenette, and says, &#x201c;Off to see the recluse.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; says Mariel, &#x201c;God. Good luck.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; says Jem. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need it. I&#x2019;ll be back in an hour.&#x201d; </p><p>Mariel smiles sympathetically, and Jem closes the door behind her. The sad irony of a trip to Almanac Road on such an auspicious date is not wasted on her. She is painfully aware of it as she walks the fifteen minutes from the office on Wands-worth Bridge Road. When she gets there, she glances down, as she always does, into the basement pit of the house at number thirty-one. </p><p>Terra-cotta tiles gleam, newly laid and freshly mopped. Three small trees carved into pom-pom balls of varying sizes sit in shiny cobalt-blue pots. The front door is thickly painted in a matte shade of mushroom and dressed with nickel-plated knobs and knockers. Through the window she can see more mushroom paint on walls hung with black-and-white photography. Suddenly, two small hands and a baby&#x2019;s head appear over the top of the sofa. Jem smiles. The baby smiles, then disappears again. </p><p>Someone else lives here now. A young family, a house-proud family with enough money to renovate the run-down flat they&#x2019;d bought a year ago, and enough foresight to have done it when the lady of the house was four months pregnant with their first child, unlike Jem, who had spent the last night of her first pregnancy on a mattress in the dining room of her sister&#x2019;s flat, her possessions piled around her in gigantic cardboard boxes, like a township, waiting for a woman in Camberwell to sell her flat to a man in Dulwich so that the owner of their new house in Herne Hill could sign the completion forms and hand them their front door keys. </p><p>Before the very neat and well-organized family lived here, a scruffy woman with a deadbeat teenage son and three obese cats had lived here. And before the scruffy woman with the fat cats, a young couple with matching bikes and raincoats had lived here. And before the smug, outdoorsy couple with the bikes, a man called Smith had lived here, alone, having an existential crisis that led, eventually, to his retraining as a Reiki teacher and relocating to San Francisco. And even longer ago than that, years before the man called Smith had lived here alone having an existential crisis, Smith&#x2019;s best friend, Ralph, had lived here with him. And so, for a very short while, over twelve years ago, back in 1996 when Oasis was the most famous band in the country and football was, supposedly, coming home, when she was a child of only twenty-seven, had Jem. </p><p>Jem can feel it, even now, as she stands on the pavement, peering through the window at strangers&#x2019; mushroom walls&#x2014;she can still feel the electric jolt of sudden promise, the thrill of new beginnings. She feels it for just a moment, and then it passes, because for some strange reason things have not worked out how she thought they might during those long-ago days and now it&#x2019;s just a dull echo of a moment in her life when fate, chance and destiny all came together and took her somewhere quite remarkable. </p><p>She sighs sadly and pushes her hair behind her ears. Then she looks up, her attention taken by the clatter of a sash window being pushed open and then a loud male voice: </p><p>&#x201c;Intercom&#x2019;s broken!&#x201d; </p><p>A small shiny object leaves his hand and hurtles toward her, catching the light as it falls, landing on the pavement within an inch of her toes. </p><p>&#x201c;Let yourself in!&#x201d; The large hands slide the noisy window back into place. Jem tuts and picks up the keys. She climbs the front steps and prepares herself, mentally, for the next half hour of her life. She picks her way through the debris of Karl&#x2019;s life: forgotten T-shirts, a broken guitar, a shopping bag full of recycling, and, oh, God, a pair of underpants. She finds him on the sofa, eating a ham sandwich and watching an old episode of <i>Murder She Wrote</i>. </p><p>&#x201c;I thought you said you needed bread?&#x201d; she says, waving the loaf of Warbutons Malted she took for him from her own kitchen cupboard that very morning. </p><p>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s the end of it. Had to scrape some spores off it, make it, you know, edible.&#x201d; He takes the fresh loaf from her and smiles, gratefully. &#x201c;Thanks, Miss Duck.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; says Jem, lowering herself onto the very farthest edge of a grubby yellow armchair. &#x201c;What happened to the cleaner?&#x201d; she asks, looking around the room. </p><p>Karl smiles, his catch-all &#x201c;forgive-me-for-I-know-not-what-I-do-but-oh-I-am-lovely-aren&#x2019;t-I?&#x201d; smile. It is a good smile, a smile that has seen him through a ten-year career in B-list television presenting, but not quite a good enough smile to stop his killing that career stone dead after a terrible episode in the Australian jungle last autumn, in front of six million viewers. &#x201c;I kept forgetting to pay her,&#x201d; he replies in his smooth Irish croon. He shrugs. &#x201c;Who can blame her?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;ve you been?&#x201d; Jem squints slightly as she asks the question, almost not wanting him to answer it. </p><p>Karl rearranges his large form on the sofa, so that he&#x2019;s facing her. &#x201c;Oh, you know, the parties, the premieres, the hot dates, it never ends.&#x201d; He looks old. Not a line on his face, not for a man of forty-seven, but his face looks dead, as if someone has taken a sheet of sandpaper to him and scoured away all the gloss, all the glitter. </p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t have to be like this, you know,&#x201d; she says, opening up the manila folder. &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s ready to forget.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What you got in there?&#x201d; he asks, eyeing the folder skeptically. </p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not money, that&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d; </p><p>He winks. &#x201c;Maybe I need a new agent,&#x201d; he jokes. </p><p>Jem sighs. Jem is Karl&#x2019;s agent, and Karl&#x2019;s joke (this is not the first time he has made it) is not funny anymore. She takes out a letter that arrived this morning, printed on sky-blue paper. It is confirmation of a phone call that she had last week with a production company that is filming a series of interviews with &#x201c;controversial&#x201d; celebrities. </p><p>Karl takes it from her and scans it, rapidly, with a furrowed brow. &#x201c;Jeez,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;what is this&#x2014;the Last Chance Saloon for Battered B-listers? Christ. You&#x2019;re going to make me do it, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; </p><p>Jem shrugs. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t make you do anything, Karl. But it&#x2019;s money in the bank&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d; he interrupts. </p><p>&#x201c;Five thousand. And if you handle it well, if you paint yourself in a good light, it&#x2019;ll open all those doors again.&#x201d; </p><p>Karl puts the paper down on the sofa and picks up his sandwich. He stares at it disconsolately for a second. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what I want,&#x201d; he says, so quietly that Jem only just hears him. </p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she replies, &#x201c;if that&#x2019;s what you want. But here&#x2019;s the thing, Karl.&#x201d; She pauses. She didn&#x2019;t come here to give Karl a piece of paper. She could have put it in the post. And she certainly didn&#x2019;t come here to replenish his bread bin. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the bottom line: if you don&#x2019;t do the interview, I&#x2019;m letting you go.&#x201d; </p><p>The words are gone now, the words that Jem has been carrying round in her head for days, for weeks. She&#x2019;s imagined this conversation a thousand times and every time her heart has raced, her skin has flushed. <i>Letting a client go</i>. And not just any client, but her first client, the one who started it all, twelve years ago. And not just a client, but a friend. It&#x2019;s harsh, but it&#x2019;s for his own good, she reminds herself&#x2014;without the threat he wouldn&#x2019;t do the TV interview, and without the TV interview there is no career for her to manage. </p><p>&#x201c;Jesus fucking Christ,&#x201d; he drawls. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s bribery!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes, though more gentle bullying, I would have said.&#x201d; Jem pauses and stares at the sleeves of Karl&#x2019;s pullover, which are encrusted with some kind of beige paste. &#x201c;I only want what&#x2019;s best for you, and I think this,&#x201d; she points at the sky-blue paper, &#x201c;is what&#x2019;s best for you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; says Karl, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stupid. It&#x2019;s fine. I hear you loud and clear. And yeah, okay, I&#x2019;ll do the show. But if it backfires in my face, I reserve the right to sack <i>you</i>.&#x201d; He winks at her, smiles, and then sighs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure life used to be simple,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there was a time.&#x201d; </p><p>Jem smiles, thinking of a night, exactly twelve years ago, when for a while life had felt far from simple. Exciting, romantic, crazy&#x2014;yes, but not simple. She thinks again about the way she&#x2019;d felt when Ralph had proclaimed his love for her, when she realized that she loved him too, when the gates to the Rest of Her Life had swung open and she&#x2019;d taken her first tentative steps onto the open road. And now she is here: separated, a single parent, inhabiting a desperate, heartbreaking place where she never expected to be. She swallows a swell of tearfulness and smiles. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s never been simple.

Alive, he had access to an eighth of the world's riches, a harem of nearly 400 women and his murder-minded heirs, all of whom were kept under virtual house arrest pending his demise. This is the world that Chase-Riboud, the prize-winning author of Sally Hemmings, painstakingly evokes. Her book is moored to an irresistible historic footnote; that in 1741, a French-American girl of 14, captured by Algerian pirates at sea, was forcibly placed in the sultan's Istanbul harem where she later bore him a son whose own accession to the throne made her an empress. So long as it adheres to this story, Valide is consistently interesting. The scenes of life in Topkapi Palace and a bewildered girl's perceptions of it, more than make up for the author's superficial characterization. A greater and ultimately debilitating fault lies with Chase-Riboud's tendency to stray too far afield: readers suddenly find themselves in France with Napoleon, at a gaming table in Russia or on the high seas with John Paul Jones. Because of this, the narrative, though often engrossing, falls short of its exceptional promise. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.A valide is a sultan's mother who administers the sultan's harem of several hundred women. Based on historical facts, this is the story of a young girl from Martinique, captured by pirates in the late 1700s, who eventually becomes a favorite of the Ottoman sultan, bears the son who succeeds him, and becomes Valide. There are detailed descriptions here of various methods of making eunuchs, the elaborate preparations of young virgins to sexually serve the sultan, the debauchery of the sultan's female relatives who must be sterilized so they can never bear a royal rival, and the precise and often varied sexual predilections of a large number of characters, including Catherine the Great . Deadly harem intrigues are juxtaposed with imperial ones in this mildly diverting historical romance. Chase-Riboud is the author of the controversial novel Sally Hemings . Patricia Y.

School Library Journal<br><br> 'Accurate and fascinating' Kirkus Reviews, April 2017 <br><br>Since the Civil War, U.S. soldiers and their canine companions have been inseparable. Over time, these dogs have shown they provide more than love. Stubby, a bull terrier in World War I, could sniff out poison mustard gas before any human in his division. Smoky, a whip-smart Yorkshire terrier, ran telegraph wire through no-man's land in World War II. Nemo, a tough-as-nails German shepherd serving in Vietnam, took a bullet in the eye, yet crawled on top of a gravely wounded soldier to protect him. Other four-footed warriors gave the ultimate sacrifice. This is the story of how dogs and soldiers became more than buddies when they were Bonded by Battle.</p><p>With machine-gun precision, Nancy Roe Pimm delivers colorful bursts of U.S. war history for all ages. Each chapter is a punchy profile in canine courage and a celebration of the bonds of hard work and sacrifice shared by all those who serve in uniform, whether on two legs or on four. --Randy Brown, author, <i>Welcome to FOB Haiku: War Poems from Inside the Wire</i><br><br>Outstanding book! Nancy has captured what it's like for both the dog and handler. It is difficult for a dog handler to express just what transpires between him (or her) and the dog to someone who has never experienced that. Nancy gets it these are dog TEAMS. The dog and soldier read each other and respond to a situation accordingly. This short book is an easy read and can help anyone from 12 to 90 to also get it. --Darrell Trent, Vietnam sentry dog handler<br><br>Students of military history and dog lovers rejoice.

Pimm points out that animals associated with military units were usually mascots (e.g., Old Abe). The Great War's Sergeant Stubby started out as a mascot but became a decorated military working dog. A chapter on 'war refugee' Rin Tin Tin is also included. The author explores the U.S. Military Working Dog program by focusing on how different dog/handler pairs participated in various wars.

The first writer in English to go back to the original European sources, Adam Zamoyski&#39;s portrait of Napoleon is historical biography at its finest. Napoleon inspires passionately held and often conflicting visions. Was he a god-like genius, Romantic avatar, megalomaniac monster, compulsive warmonger or just a nasty little dictator? While he displayed elements of these traits at certain times, Napoleon was none of these things. He was a man and, as Adam Zamoyski presents him in this landmark biography, a rather ordinary one at that. He exhibited some extraordinary qualities during some phases of his life but it is hard to credit genius to a general who presided over the worst (and self-inflicted) disaster in military history and who single-handedly destroyed the great enterprise he and others had toiled so hard to construct. A brilliant tactician, he was no strategist. But nor was Napoleon an evil monster. He could be selfish and violent but there is no evidence of him wishing to inflict suffering gratuitously. His motives were mostly praiseworthy and his ambition no greater than that of contemporaries such as Alexander I of Russia, Wellington, Nelson and many more. What made his ambition exceptional was the scope it was accorded by circumstance. Adam Zamoyski strips away the lacquer of prejudice and places Napoleon the man within the context of his times. In the 1790s, a young Napoleon entered a world at war, a bitter struggle for supremacy and survival with leaders motivated by a quest for power and by self-interest. He did not start this war but it dominated his life and continued, with one brief interruption, until his final defeat in 1815. Based on primary sources in many European languages, and beautifully illustrated with portraits done only from life, this magnificent book examines how Napoleone Buonaparte, the boy from Corsica, became &#39;Napoleon&#39;; how he achieved what he did, and how it came about that he undid it. It does not justify or condemn but seeks instead to understand Napoleon&#39;s extraordinary trajectory.</p><p></p><h2>Contact with Chaos (Freehold Series)</h2><p>Warning: Aliens Ahead. <br><br>First Time in Paperback.

Then there was the U.N., which controlled the planet Earth. Earth and Freehold were not on good terms, to put it mildly, and the U.N. immediately sent its own ship to make contact with the Ithkuil. If the authoritarians from Earth started throwing their weight around, Freehold would have to push back, causing anything from a diplomatic incident to outright war.

A native of New Zealand, she is the author of eleven novels, four collections of stories, a volume of poetry, a children&#39;s book, and her heartfelt and courageous autobiography--all published by George Braziller.Janet Frame is one of New Zealand&#39;s literary treasures, and her first novel, OWLS DO CRY, published in 1957, is considered a masterpiece. Celebrating its 50th anniversary, the novel chronicles the harrowing experiences of 14-year-old Daphne, diagnosed schizophrenic and confined to a mental institution. Much of Daphne&#39;s story unfolds in stream-of-consciousness ramblings, the hallucinatory, lyrical poetry that marks the music of madness. Heather Bolton&#39;s voice is soft and intriguing, a voice clearly from another world. When Daphne sings her poetry, Bolton&#39;s wispy, compelling school-girl soprano confirms that this book is a perfect fit for audio. Voices from the outside world come mainly from Daphne&#39;s sister, Teresa&#39;s, detailed diaries. Bolton handles the more grounded prose with ease, while making Daphne&#39;s surreal interior monologues strange, beautiful, and haunting. S.J.H.

Many critics complained of the book called &#34;Heretics&#34; because it merely criticised current philosophies without offering any alternative philosophy. This book is an attempt to answer the challenge. It is unavoidably affirmative and therefore unavoidably autobiographical. The writer has been driven back upon somewhat the same difficulty as that which beset Newman in writing his Apologia; he has been forced to be egotistical only in order to be sincere. While everything else may be different the motive in both cases is the same. It is the purpose of the writer to attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian Faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it. The book is therefore arranged upon the positive principle of a riddle and its answer. It deals first with all the writer&#39;s own solitary and sincere speculations and then with all the startling style in which they were all suddenly satisfied by the Christian Theology. The writer regards it as amounting to a convincing creed. But if it is not that it is at least a repeated and surprising coincidence.</p><p>G.K. Chesterton was born in 1874 in the district of Kensington - London, England. After studying art at the Slade School, and literature at University College in London, the young writer embarked on what was to become a daring and unique literary career. Although his greatest desire was to be known as a journalist, Chesterton would also author volumes of poetry, together with piercing criticisms of contemporary society and its views. His fiction works would sell well, with titles such as &#34;The Man Who Was Thursday&#34;, a thriller combining espionage and metaphysics, and &#34;The Everlasting Man&#34;, which chronicles mankind&#39;s spiritual journey. Following his authorship of many essays surrounding Christianity and Catholicism, Chesterton converted to Catholicism in 1922. The author is also popularly known for his Father Brown books - a priest and detective, this popular character first appeared in &#34;The Innocence of Father Brown&#34;. Chesterton died of heart failure at home in 1936, and was posthumously lauded and venerated by figures both literary and religious. In the 21st century, he has been considered a possible figure for canonization for his ample writings on Christianity.</p><h2>Discerning the Mystery</h2><p>This book is among the finest critiques of the Enlightenment&#39;s ways of knowing, coupled with a winsome description of a distinctly Christian alternative. Responding to what he sees as a &#34;division and fragmentation&#34; both in theology and the larger culture due to &#34;the one-sided way we have come to seek and recognize truth...manifest in the way in which all concern with truth has been relinquished to the sciences,&#34; Louth sets out to describe the source of that fragmentation and to challenge the notion that we must &#34;accept the lot bequeathed to us by the Enlightenment.&#34; He carefully reviews central themes of several precursors who have already forged a critique of the epistemological imperialism of the Enlightenment, principally Giambattista Vico, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Hans-Georg Gadamer, who in distinct ways demonstrated the legitimacy of the humanities&#39; unique apprehension of truth. Further relativizing Enlightenment claims, Michael Polanyi proposed that science itself depends on non-empirical elements of investigation for its method to function, what he termed &#34;the tacit dimension.&#34; It is here that Louth sees a &#34;pattern underlying the apprehension of truth&#34; that is strikingly similar to that of the Fathers of the Church, who set forth an approach to knowing and experiencing truth that ultimately can be &#34;seen and heard and handled&#34; (1 John 1:1-3), but only by those who reside in the bosom of the Church&#39;s tradition and avail themselves of ways of knowing unique to it. Louth&#39;s rather brilliant rehabilitation of the Fathers&#39; use of allegory in scriptural interpretation, which interweaves Scripture and tradition seamlessly, illustrates this approach. The matrix of allegory requires and manifests the &#34;tacit dimension&#34; of the guidance of the Spirit, and underlines the theologian&#39;s need to hear Him. Or as Evagrios of Pontus might put it, &#34;Knowledge of God-the breast of the Lord. To recline there-the making of a theologian.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Cervantes (Bloom&#39;s Modern Critical Views)</h2><p>A collection of critical essays on Cervantes and his works.

By the Caldecott Medalist for The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses.</p><p>Grade 1-3?White Hawk and Tall Bear are great friends, or kolas, sworn to do everything together, including die in one another's defense. The friendship is strained however, when they both fall in love with Red Leaf, and White Hawk betrays his friend, leaving him to starve on a remote ledge of a high butte. Tall Bear survives with the help of a family of eagles who feed and care for him as though he were one of their own. When the eaglets grow in size, they carry Tall Bear safely down to the Earth. He returns to the village, and White Hawk flees in disgrace. Tall Bear marries Red Leaf and together they visit his friends, cementing the relationship between the "Two-legged People" and the "Eagle Nation." Goble's retelling of this Plains Indian story is somewhat sanitized when compared to Jenny Leading Cloud's version in The Sound of the Flutes and Other Indian Legends (Pantheon, 1976; o.p.). Nevertheless, this version remains an absorbing tale. The watercolor illustrations, as usual, are excellent. However, two disturbing elements must be pointed out. The author felt compelled to note that the "traditional kola friendship of two Lakota men, as described in this story, was never a homosexual relationship." He follows this totally unnecessary statement with a condescending note to teachers, discouraging them from having students write their own "Indian" stories as it "belittles these traditional stories." If you are willing to overlook these remarks, this book will make a nice addition to most collections.?George Delalis, Chicago Public Library<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3-5. In this sophisticated picture book, Goble retells a Lakota legend of betrayal and love. Two young warriors swear friendship, but when they become rivals for the same maiden, one abandons the other on a rocky ledge. Saved by eagles, the abandoned warrior returns to his village and shames his former friend into leaving, then marries the girl. The illustrations are vintage Goble--stylized figures in historically accurate clothing, outlined in white and set against landscapes of vast sky or dark, slanting rock. The text includes some terms in Lakota language (in boldface type), and there's an introductory note on the tale's source as well as a cautionary note to teachers about assigning children the task of writing "imitation Indian" stories. <i>Mary Harris Veeder</i></p><h2>George C.

Marshall than any other Army Chief of Staff or Secretary of Defense and almost any Secretary of State. This is not another one. Stewart Husted recognizes that for Marshall leadership was a verb, not a noun, and this book conjugates it. It is a leadership book bereft of most academic jargon--no collaborative synergisms, no Type A, B, or even C, no Theory X or Y, nothing approaching charismatic, not even a paradigm, shifting or not shifting.</p><p>The Marshall Library, Bland's Papers, Pogue's Marshall, and nearly 100 other sources have been carefully plumbed to extract and glean Marshall leading, Marshall talking about leading, and Marshall teaching leadership. Only the biography and history is repeated as are necessary to putting the leadership issue in context. And the context is as current as tonight's CNN or Fox News--preparation for war, diversity, the United Nations, negotiating with France, disloyal generals, overreaching politicians, dealing with Russia and China. In this milieu, it should be noted that this is a book about democratic (small D) leadership.</p></li></p><p>Stewart W.

This assault claimed more than 250 lives, including those of many Indian women and children. The tragedy at Wounded Knee has often been written about, but the existing photographs have received little attention until now.</p><p><i>Eyewitness at Wounded Knee</i> brings together and assesses for the first time some 150 photographs that were made before and immediately after the massacre.

She lives in Texas and recommends keeping a supply of green chili BBQ sauce on hand...just in case. Visit her at www.kathyduval.com.<br>Adam McCauley (www.adammccauley.com) has illustrated several books for children including<em>Wayside School is Falling Down</em> by Louis Sachar, Jon Sciezska's <em>Time Warp Trio</em>series, and <em>Oh No, Not Ghosts!</em> by Richard Michelson. He received the Society of Illustrator's Gold Medal for his work on<em>The Monsterologist: A Memoir in Rhyme</em> by Bobbi Katz. He lives in San Francisco, CA. When he's not riding around in his UFO, Adam loves to barbeque.Many people boast that their barbecue is out of this world, but Willy's fine-smelling and lip-smacking meal attracts visitors from outer space. McCauley chooses a sweltering palette of yellow, brown and peach to cast the hardworking farmer on a hot Texas day. Observant readers will spot the flying saucer approaching as twilight falls. Soon, the inky black of space descends with the spaceship: "Some colored lights from outer space / Are lightin' up the whole dang place!" Here, pastel shots of color serve to spotlight the alarmed animals of the farm, while a sinuous, pale yellow, wavy band of smoke wafts through the scene. The amazing aroma has drawn the "small green men" out to sample the fare and dance a "DO-SI-DO a-fore [they] go." They claim, "We don't want your leader, Willy, / Just your BARBECUE and chili." Duval chooses just the right amount of Texas twang to spice up the lively rhyming text. But soon, the aliens have taken over like unwanted party guests. They have had fun, wreaked some havoc and left the farm damaged. So Willy and his pet cat and dog board the UFO. A gatefold opens to show a map of their travels in space. The other side reveals the destination-a planet where various ET's are enjoying a meal and some music at Willy's new restaurant. The knee-slapping humor, retro feel of the illustrations and the included recipe for Willy's special sauce serve up some spicy preschool fun. (Picture book. 3-6) Kirkus"<br><br>Plumb tired after a heck of a workday, Willy's a-fixing to grill himself up some ribs when a flying saucer causes a ruckus by lowering over his desert shack. "Cat's meowin', cow's a lowin'. / Dog's a-howlin', chicken's GLOWIN'!" Out scampers a big mess of "greenies"-three-eyed aliens drawn by that heavenly smell. "We don't want your leader, Willy, / Just your barbecue and chili." Down the hatch go the ribs (the cowboy hat tastes pretty good with hot sauce, too), but while the greenies are stomping their boots along to Willy's fiddle, Willy sneaks aboard the ship and takes off across the galaxy-a three-page foldout tracks his progress-to enjoy sweet success as the owner of Willy's BBQ on an alien planet. Duval has a darned good time mixing up a stew of western and sci-fi tropes, while McCauley marshals his watercolors into earth tones for the desert and pastels for the UFO lights. Occasional wordless spreads let readers bask in the goofiness, and a recipe for Willy's Out of This World Barbecue Sauce concludes. - Daniel Kraus Booklist"<br><br>K-Gr 2 While tending his grill, an unsuspecting Willy is visited by "some colored lights from outer space," and three-eyed, little green men wearing spurs appear and apparently have a craving for some chili. With a knee-slappin' rhythm, the occasional hitch in the rhyme scheme, and a few too many gratuitous "yippee ki-yee's," Willy rustles up some grub and plays the fiddle till his guests drop. Then he pulls the ol' switcheroo and takes their ship for a ride. The final pages show Willy throwin' down at his very own BBQ joint on their home planet while the aliens tend his turnips. McCauley's illustrations use rich desert colors and comic proportions to play up the wacky story line. The recipe for "Willy's Out of This World Barbecue Sauce" might inspire a tasty food-themed program.

Due to strict religious and moral codes, even photographing a woman inside her home without a scarf covering her head is all but impossible. Evidence of the censure of media in Iran has always been visible to Western nations, and has been brought to the forefront in the wake of the recent elections held there.&nbsp;<br><br> But, Tehran has a drug problem. On the streets, in back alleys, and in small, crumbling, low-cost apartments, Iranian crack addicts are finding their fix in steadily rising numbers. The crack&#x2014;a term used to describe many types of crystallized narcotics&#x2014;currently flooding the streets of Tehran is different from that found in the West in a significant way: the &#x201c;black crack&#x201d; in Iran is made from heroin, not cocaine. Intent on documenting the plight of these masses of addicts, Aslon Arfa struck out into the underbelly of modern Tehran, camera in tow. The results of his mission, compiled here in <i><b>Black Crack in Iran</b></i>, are devastating images of men and women in the midst of a downfall. Some, including a young man with glazed eyes and infected burns stretching across his torso, are closer to the bottom than others.<br><br> Further complicating the documentation of the epidemic are the shame of addiction, the misunderstanding and disapproval of drug use by outsiders, and the lack of trust from suffering people whose sickness is also a crime punishable by death. Yet, after months spent in the trenches, Arfa has succeeded in bringing the closed-door activities of Iran&#x2019;s most unseemly citizens to light in <i><b>Black Crack in Iran</b></i>.</p><p><b>Aslon Arfa </b>was born in Tehran, in 1970. When he was 17, he became a photo assistant for Kamran Adle (a noted Iranian photographer) and worked with him for several years. Arfa studied Atomic Physics at Tehran University, but after graduating he started working as a photographer for <i>Danestaniha</i> magazine where he worked until 1998. He also worked for an Iranian newspaper for a year and spent another year working for <i>Iranvich Daily</i>. Arfa has worked on several journalistic photography projects, documenting such subjects as women in the Peshmerga (Kurdish military forces) of northern Iraq, the life of Afghans in Northern Afghanistan, the repatriation of Afghans from Iran, and Iran&#x2019;s martial arts.

Tacky's back, along with his proper penguin pals, Goodly, Lovely, Angel, Neatly, and Perfect. They are in school now, and, as usual, Tacky has his own way of doing things. When the friends enter the great Penguin Cheering Contest, the main concern is whether Tacky can get the cheer right. He handles the situation in his own unique style and once again proves that although he's "an odd bird," he's certainly "a nice bird to have around." Although there is a touch of predictability to the story for those already familiar with previous stories, this one is a smooth, fun read. Munsinger's full-color illustrations are charming and subtle. The penguins wear sweaters and caps; Tacky wears his over a Hawaiian shirt, and his cap is askew.

After all, given their current assignment, what could possibly be so pressing?<br><br>Located well within the admittedly small sector of the galaxy that had been mapped and traversed by Vulcan ships, this area of space was one Vanik had traveled numerous times during his fifteen years as commander of the <i>Ti'Mur.</i> Other than its status as the location of a single minor conflict during the protracted war with the Andorians, the region offered little of interest. None of the planets in the area's lone star system were habitable, and they contained nothing of scientific or strategic value. The only quality the area possessed, in Vanik's opinion, was that it had few distractions to delay a vessel's journey to some other, more appealing destination.<br><br><i>Has this somehow changed?</i><br><br>He had only just settled into his evening's meditation when the message came from the officer on duty. Well aware of her captain's routine, Sub-commander T'Lih would not have intruded on his private time unless she believed it was a matter for his attention. Whatever it was that had prompted her call, it must be quite fascinating indeed.<br><br><i>Of course,</i> Vanik reminded himself, f<i>urther speculation serves no purpose. My questions will be answered in short order.</i><br><br>The turbolift slowed to a halt and the doors parted to reveal the <i>Ti'Mur's</i> bridge. Triangular-shaped, the command center was widest at the rear stations, with rows of control consoles to either side and angling inward until they met the immense viewscreen dominating the forward bulkhead. Unlike other areas of the ship, where lighting was adjusted in order to simulate the daily cycle on Vulcan, Vanik preferred the command center's illumination to remain at normal levels regardless of the time of day.<br><br>Each of the bridge's key stations was manned despite the lateness of the hour, just as they would be during prime shift, yet the captain also noted a crew member operating the secondary science console. A visual inspection of the weapons station showed that the defensive systems were not active, meaning that no threats to the ship had been detected. Even from across the room, he could hear the two separate conversations taking place between members of the bridge crew and detected nothing untoward being discussed.<br><br>Stepping from the turbolift, Vanik nodded in greeting to T'Lih as the subcommander noticed his arrival.<br><br>"Good evening, Captain," she offered as she rose from the command chair at the rear of the bridge. Like every other member of the ship's complement, T'Lih wore the standard gray uniform of the Vulcan Space Service. Impeccably tailored to her physique, the uniform possessed no decorative accessories save for the small rank insignia on the left side of her collar. Like Vanik's own, her features were lean and angular, but while his hair was gray and full-bodied, T'Lih wore her black locks cropped close to her skull in a manner that served to highlight the severe upswing of her pointed ears.<br><br>"And to you, Sub-commander," Vanik replied. "So, what is it that has attracted your interest?" Rather than take the proffered seat T'Lih had vacated, he chose instead to pace the room's perimeter, walking a slow circuit with hands clasped behind his back as he waited for the subcommander to make her report.<br><br>Moving to join her captain, T'Lih replied, "Fifty-two point six minutes ago, our long-range sensors detected an object traveling at warp one point three. A review of our data banks shows that it is of a type and configuration unknown to us."<br><br>"Life signs?" Vanik prompted.<br><br>"No, Captain. The object appears to be an unmanned drone. It is transmitting a recorded message that repeats at intervals of four point seven minutes. Translation efforts are already under way, and I have also ordered an attempt to determine the drone's origin point based on its current course heading."<br><br>Vanik nodded, pleased with the report and the subcommander's initiative, which also logically explained the presence of additional science personnel on the bridge. "Is it close enough for visual inspection?"<br><br>By way of reply, T'Lih summoned the attention of the junior officer working at the main science station. "Lieutenant Serel?"<br><br>The object that appeared on the bridge's central viewer in response to the science officer's commands was unlike anything Vanik had seen before. It consisted of a bulky cylindrical module mounted above a trio of squat engine bells. The cylinder's outer shell was composed of metal plating, and Vanik could see the join lines as well as the heads of dozens of fasteners that presumably attached the individual plates to a skeletal frame. Two antenna dishes were affixed to the cylinder's flanks, one of which appeared to have suffered damage. In fact, pockmarks and other blemishes were clearly discernible across the surface of the small craft.<br><br>"The damage is consistent with the effects of ion storms we have seen on our vessel's hulls," Serel reported from his station. "According to our scans, exposure to such a storm most likely occurred approximately eleven point six years ago."<br><br>"What have you learned about its level of technology?" Vanik asked.<br><br>"Though we will have to retrieve the drone in order to complete a thorough investigation," the science officer replied, "its propulsion system looks to be quite rudimentary. I would theorize that the warp drive was of an experimental nature, perhaps the first such test made by whoever constructed the object."<br><br><i>Interesting,</i> Vanik thought. Given that the craft was obviously primitive, in all likelihood a first-generation deep-space vessel, that it had survived such an encounter relatively intact and still able to transmit data was a testament to its designers' craftsmanship.<br><br>Could this drone be the initial step toward first contact with a new species? Though he had worn the uniform of the Space Service for seventy-six years, he had participated in only one other introduction to an alien race. Vanik had to confess that the opportunity to do so again presented an intriguing notion.<br><br>He heard a telltale tone from Serel's console and turned to see the junior officer rising from his chair. "I have a report on the status of our translation efforts, Captain," Serel said as he crossed the bridge to stand before Vanik and T'Lih. "The object has sustained considerable damage during its journey. Much of the message is garbled beyond our ability to decipher. However, I was able to isolate several passages. The people who constructed the drone call themselves the Dokaalan, and the device itself was not launched from their homeworld as part of an exploration initiative. Rather, it seems that the message is a distress call."<br><br>Vanik's right eyebrow rose in response. An entire planet calling for help? What could have prompted such a desperate act? "Did the message include a reason for their plea?"<br><br>"Yes, Captain," Serel replied. "Their planet was undergoing global seismic events that threatened to destroy it, and science specialists among their people predicted total obliteration within one of their years. Though they had discovered the ability to travel at light speeds, they possessed no space vessels capable of transporting people to another habitable planet. They therefore sent out a trio of unmanned craft in the hopes of contacting someone who could come to their aid."<br><br>Already beginning to surmise the likely outcome of this scenario, Vanik was nevertheless obligated to consider what course of action, if any, he could undertake in response to the distress call. "Are we able to determine where the object originated?"<br><br>Turning to the secondary science station, T'Lih said, "Sub-commander Taren?"<br><br>"According to our sensor scans of its onboard systems," Taren replied, "it appears to have traveled on a constant course at a consistent speed for thirty-eight point three years. This places its likely origin point in an area of space that according to our databases is presently unexplored."<br><br>It took little effort for Vanik to comprehend the futility of the Dokaalan's actions. Even if the drone had been able to travel at a faster speed, had its creators not understood the improbability of making contact with anyone possessing the resources to render assistance on such a scale? Perhaps they had, and yet the dire situation they faced nevertheless compelled them to make the attempt.<br><br>"Given what has already been learned," Vanik said, "and presuming the Dokaalan scientists were correct in their original predictions, it would seem the time to provide assistance has long passed." It was an unfortunate determination to reach, he knew, but the facts currently available to them seemed to support no other conclusion.<br><br>"Captain," T'Lih said, "we could deploy a reconnaissance probe back along the drone's original course. It will take several months to reach that area of space at the probe's maximum speed, but it will be able to ascertain what ultimately happened to the Dokaalan homeworld."<br><br>It was a logical suggestion, and one Vanik at first supported. However, as this matter involved a species never before encountered, it was an issue that would have to be decided upon by the Vulcan Science Directorate. Only that august body possessed the authority to permit any interaction with a new race, a precaution intended to prevent the accidental introduction of technology, science, or even ideas that might prove too advanced for a culture not yet ready to possess such knowledge.<br><br>Besides, the <i>Ti'Mur</i> had other priorities. High Command had instructed Vanik to deviate from its current patrol in order to observe the latest activities of <i>Enterprise,</i> the deep-space exploration vessel recently launched by the humans from Earth. Though the humans themselves held little interest for him, Vanik nevertheless had kept abreast of their progress, especially regarding their efforts to perfect warp travel and push farther away from the confines of their own star system.<br><br>It had long been the opinion of High Command that the humans bore watching. Though they had proven to be somewhat innovative in their own way, they had also demonstrated that their inexperience in dealing with a larger celestial community, to say nothing of their own arrogance and overconfidence, likely would be their undoing.<br><br>Since <i>Enterprise</i> had left Earth, its crew and particularly its captain had managed to make quite a nuisance of themselves. That much was amply demonstrated when the vessel departed Earth on its inaugural voyage, deep into the heart of the Klingon Empire of all places. Only fortunate happenstance had prevented their initial contact with the Klingons from dissolving into an unmitigated disaster, and Vanik believed that the ultimate ramifications of the haphazard encounter were yet to be realized.<br><br>Then there was the recent debacle that had unfolded at the monastery on P'Jem. The <i>Enterprise</i> captain, Archer, had revealed the presence of the top-secret observation facility hidden beneath the monastery to Andorian operatives. Now that station and the vital data it provided about ship movements and other activities within Andorian space was gone, and the damage Archer had inflicted on Vulcan's intelligence-gathering operations would take a long time to repair.<br><br>Given all of that, Vanik could understand High Command's wishes that the Earth ship be monitored. He simply did not agree with the dispatching of a <i>Surak</i>-class vessel to do it. He hoped that <i>Enterprise</i> would be able to avoid trouble for the few days until the <i>Ti'Mur</i> was relieved by another vessel.<br><br>"Sub-commander T'Lih," he said, "prepare all of the information you have for transmission to High Command. In the interim, divert from our present course long enough to retrieve the drone, then adjust our course and speed to make our appointment on schedule."<br><br>"Yes, Captain," T'Lih replied, and set about relaying the necessary orders. As Vanik paced back to his command chair, he watched and listened as his bridge crew turned to their various tasks, satisfied that they would carry out their duties with their usual impeccable efficiency.<br><br>Settling into his seat, the captain realized he was actually looking forward to what a full examination of the alien object might reveal. If nothing else, the effort would pass the time until the rendezvous with the Earth ship.<br><br>It would be up to High Command and the Science Directorate as to whether a vessel was sent to discover the origin of the alien drone and perhaps to learn what had happened to those who had dispatched it, but Vanik for one hoped the attempt was made. Given the calamity they had apparently suffered, it would be unfortunate if the mystery of the Dokaalan were to remain unsolved.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Paramount Pictures.

He&#x2019;d served with the famous Night Stalkers on countless such missions. This one turned out very different. Months later, he regained consciousness in a US military hospital, with no memory of how he&#x2019;d gotten there. The first words he heard were from his surgeon telling him he would never walk again. The determined soldier responded: &#x201c;Sir, yes, I will.&#x201d;<br> <br>After multiple surgeries, unbearable chronic pain, and numerous setbacks, Morgan was finally making progress when his wife left him and their three young sons. He was a single father confined to a wheelchair and tortured by his pain. At this very dark, very low point, Morgan found light: Napal, the black Labrador who would change his life forever.<br> <br><i>A Dog Called Hope</i> is the incredible story of a remarkable service dog who brought a devastated warrior back from the brink. It is the story of one funny, lovable dog&#x2019;s power to heal a family and teach a wounded man how to be a true father. It is the story of an amazing dog with boundless loyalty who built bridges between his wheelchair-bound battle buddy and the rest of able-bodied humankind. It is the story of how one very special dog gave a man&#x2019;s life true meaning. Humorous, intensely moving, and uplifting, Jason and Napal&#x2019;s heartwarming tale will brighten any day and lift every heart.</p><p>Originally from Texas, Jason Morgan served as an Air Force Weather Specialist with the 10th Combat Weather Squadron, a Special Forces unit, before joining the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), more commonly known as the Night Stalkers. He now works to raise the profile of service dog availability for wounded warriors and others, campaigns for disability awareness, competes in a variety of Paralympics sports, speaks at veteran events, and raises three teenage boys.<br><br>Damien Lewis is a lifelong dog lover and award-winning writer who has spent twenty years reporting from war, disaster, and conflict zones for the BBC and other global news organizations. He is the bestselling author of more than twenty books, including several acclaimed memoirs about military working dogs<i>&#x2014;Sergeant Rex, </i><i>It&#x2019;s All About Treo</i>, <i>Judy, </i>and <i>The Dog Who Could Fly.</i>A Dog Called Hope 1<p></p> <br>The air was slick with moisture yet burning hot all at the same time.<br> <br>As I waited for the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to fire up its giant turbines, I ran my eye along the column of brother warriors lined up on this sunbaked tropical runway&#x2014;each American, like me, dressed in unmarked combat fatigues. For a mission such as this, you never wear a mark of unit or rank or anything that might betray your identity, just in case things go wrong. If taken prisoner, you don&#x2019;t want anything on your person that might distinguish you as being particularly special.<br> <br>Like my fellow warriors, I&#x2019;d sanitized myself completely, removing all patches from my clothing and not carrying a single piece of ID or family memento, anything that might link me to my nationality or my unit. Carrying even a photo of my wife and three infant boys was a strict no-no.<br> <br>Such precautions had to be taken utterly seriously when involved in this kind of war against this kind of an adversary. We were in Ecuador, training that country&#x2019;s special forces to fight FARC&#x2014;the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&#x2014;a notorious rebel group that finances its operations from kidnap and ransom, illegal mining, and most of all, drugs.<br> <br>FARC&#x2019;s narcotics-smuggling network stretches from the South American jungle as far north as the USA and east across the Atlantic into Europe. With an income of some $300 million a year and tens of thousands of armed fighters under its command, FARC is a well-armed battle-hardened force constrained by none of the normal rules of war. They have gained a reputation for horrific brutality and are the last people you&#x2019;d ever want to mess with.<br> <br>I checked my watch. We were twenty minutes to getting airborne.<br> <br>I glanced at my two jump buddies, Will and Travis&#x2014;their sleeves rolled up, shirts unbuttoned at the neck&#x2014;looking easy and relaxed. Hailing from the Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), a renowned U.S. Army special forces unit, they looked like they were stepping out for a practice jump over Florida and not heading into a jungle full of the world&#x2019;s foremost narco-rebels. It was the late 1990s, and the SOAR&#x2014;also known as the 160th, the Night Stalkers&#x2014;had taken casualties on previous missions here. What we were stepping into was a deadly serious business. But for Will and Travis it was just another day of doing what they loved. And, truth be told, it was getting to feel that way for me, too.<br> <br>Since I was an Air Force Special Operations guy, it had taken a good while for the SOAR to come to accept me. The competition between army and air force is merciless, and we&#x2019;d never want it any other way, since the intense rivalry serves to sharpen both arms of the military, but I&#x2019;d been with the SOAR for months now and I was getting to feel like very much one of the boys.<br> <br>We were here working with the Ecuadorian special forces&#x2014;the 9th Special Forces Brigade, better known as PATRIA&#x2014;to combat FARC and put a stop to the illegal drugs trade. But practically speaking, we could never train these guys if our remit only ever kept us in the rear with the gear. The only way to do it properly was to go out into the field alongside them. Though the Ecuadorians were lined up with us, they were a long way from being sanitized. Each wore the distinctive PATRIA badge on his left sleeve, a skull flanked by daggers with a cobra twined through its empty eye sockets. The way they saw it, if they were captured by FARC, they&#x2019;d face a horrific death anyway, so why bother disguising what unit they were from?<br> <br>The enmity between the narco-rebels and the armed forces here ran very deep, and neither side was inclined to show much mercy. We were about to fly north into the remote and lawless Cordillera Central, a spine of jungle-clad mountains snaking into neighboring Colombia. Intelligence reports suggested that FARC was using the rivers there to traffic drugs from the heart of the rain forest to the outside world, with America as their likely end destination. The PATRIA boys planned to stake out one of those rivers, put a stop to any narcotics operations, and take prisoners from whom further intelligence could be garnered to help break the drug-trafficking network.<br> <br>Our role was to train them to prosecute these kinds of missions more effectively, and this was the type of tasking that we could wholeheartedly believe in. We were fighting the good fight against entirely the right kind of enemy, and despite their lack of experience and expertise (or maybe because of it), we&#x2019;d grown close to the PATRIA guys. They were ideal trainees, like the proverbial sponges, ready to suck up all that we could throw at them. And boy, did they have a lot to learn.<br> <br>From behind me, I heard a high-pitched whine as the starter motors on the Hercules fired up the aircraft&#x2019;s engines. Gradually, the massive hook-bladed propellers spooled up to speed, the avgas&#x2014;aviation fuel&#x2014;burning fierce and heady in the hot sludgy air.<br> <br>As I turned to mount up the aircraft, Jim offered me a high five. &#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;re on! Way to go, Goshman!&#x201d;<br> <br>My SOAR teammates called me Goshman because I never cussed much, and especially not around my parents or anyone in authority. That was just the way my folks had raised me. The most I ever managed was a &#x201c;gosh.&#x201d; Hence the nickname. But that hadn&#x2019;t stopped the 16oth from making me one of their own. Recently, I&#x2019;d been pulled aside by our unit commander. He&#x2019;d told me that since I was serving with the SOAR, I&#x2019;d get to wear the Night Stalkers flash as well as my Air Force Special Operations Badge. I had the Night Stalkers badge on my right shoulder and my Air Force Special Operations badge on my left chest pocket. It was highly unusual to wear both, and I felt hugely honored to do so.<br> <br>We mounted up the aircraft; I pulled on my helmet and fastened the strap beneath my chin, settling into the fold-down canvas seat. We took to the skies. The aircraft executed a short climb, then thundered low and fast across the treetops, keeping below any radar. Going low also reduced the threat of ground fire because you&#x2019;d flash past in a matter of seconds and be gone.<br> <br>I was seated in the plane&#x2019;s tail section, next to a massive heap of rucksacks secured to the floor by netting. Through the partially open ramp, I could see the jungle speeding by. It felt close enough almost to reach out and touch the highest treetops. The pilot sure knew his stuff. If he had taken the Hercules any lower, its propellers would have been shaving the topmost branches.<br> <br>We sped onward across the carpet of green, the wind noise and the throbbing roar of the turbines killing the chance of any chat. Now and again there was a break in the forest canopy, marking a river, a narrow trail, or a jungle village. But 99 percent of what we were flying over was pure wilderness.<br> <br>As with so many previous flights, I bore a special responsibility for getting this one airborne. I just hoped and prayed that I&#x2019;d called it right this time. As I gazed out over the jungle, I reflected on what had brought me to this position&#x2014;an air force guy embedded within an elite army unit. I hailed from a tiny, little-known outfit&#x2014;the 10th Combat Weather Squadron, part of Air Force Special Operations Command. The 10th was a seventy-two-strong unit when I was a part of it. Only sixty of us were jump-trained and mission-qualified and thus able to undertake the kind of task I was now on.<br> <br>Combat weathermen do pretty much what you&#x2019;d guess: We draw up the weather picture for combat operations. As such, we need to be first in on any mission, predicting the weather at the target&#x2014;and above the target, if it&#x2019;s an airborne mission&#x2014;and helping determine if it can go ahead.<br> <br>Air Force Weather School is one of the hardest military courses there is. It&#x2019;s not just predicting when it&#x2019;s going to be partly cloudy so folks can better plan their barbecues. It&#x2019;s about anticipating what type of cloud formations will be present at what altitudes, what the visibility will be for aircraft heading through those clouds, and when exactly they&#x2019;ll hit the heart of a thunderstorm. It&#x2019;s learning how a hailstone forms with concentric rings, like a tree, and what makes it burst out the top of a cloud like popcorn and plummet to earth in a dark curtain of ice. It&#x2019;s getting to know local weather, and predicting when storms may occur, and what the conditions will be like when they do. It&#x2019;s working out how to read the weather in order to make snap decisions on the ground.<br> <br>Mission-critical decisions.<br> <br>When I went through weather school, we started as sixteen, and only three from our original class made it all the way. We had to score 80 percent or higher on all tests to move to the next section. Weather school took about a year, with over fifteen hundred hours of classroom instruction.<br> <br>Combat weathermen have to pass Air Force Special Operations selection and combat weather school. Having done so, I felt as if I&#x2019;d truly made it. My first assignment with the 10th Combat Weather was on attachment to the army&#x2019;s 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Life was good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. apart from one thing. My job&#x2014;briefing pilots on weather conditions&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t really do it for me.<br> <br>I stuck at it for about two years, until word went around that the SOAR was seeking volunteers. When you have guys going deep behind enemy lines, as the SOAR do, it&#x2019;s vital that they know what weather&#x2019;s coming. Only air force guys can become combat weathermen. The SOAR is an iconic regiment, and my commander personally asked me if I&#x2019;d be willing to join them.<br> <br>I talked it through with my wife, Carla. She&#x2019;d always been supportive of everything I&#x2019;d ever done, but for once she asked me not to follow my dream. We both knew that operations with the SOAR were dangerous. Carla told me that she had a dark premonition, a really bad feeling, about this one. She had a sense that something terrible was going to happen to me if I transferred to the SOAR.<br> <br>But my commander stressed how much they needed me, and I sure wanted to go. In due course I transferred from Fort Bragg to Hunter Army Airfield, the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion of the 160th Night Stalkers, and moved my family up there, too. Carla and I had three boys under the age of four, so ours was one busy household. We purchased a modest one-story house with a wraparound porch, room enough for the boys to bounce around in.<br> <br>At Hunter I was introduced to the &#x201c;Skiff,&#x201d; a hyper-secure underground vault protected by a series of massive code-activated doors. The Skiff was the nerve center of SOAR operations, and it was from there that I would study the weather as it affected their missions around the world. I threw myself into my new task, striving to prove that an air force guy could be as good as any army man. I was at the front of all the training runs. I had to be. If I slipped back, I&#x2019;d get all the usual abuse about being a &#x201c;pansy-assed air force guy.&#x201d; And, like many a Morgan before me, I thrilled to the challenge.<br> <br>I grew to feel at home among these army aviators. Despite Carla&#x2019;s warnings, I thrived.<br> <br>I worked my weather data like a magician. I conjured statistics to predict how storms would impact visibility or communications, or how wind speeds at the different altitudes of a parachute jump might enable a squad of paratroopers to hit a landing zone pretty much simultaneously. I sought current and tidal data so we could do airborne insertions into water: I knew that if the current was more than one mile an hour, our guys would not be able to make headway against it while swimming. If we aimed to hit a beach, I needed to know the high- and low-tide times so I could advise on the best time of landing. Because sound travels more clearly through water than air, in damp, humid conditions I had to warn our guys that the enemy would hear us coming from much farther away.<br> <br>I tried to use the weather to best advantage, while warning how it might hinder operations. After prolonged rain, a river might be rendered too hazardous to cross, making our planned exit from a target unworkable. If it was a sniper mission, I needed to predict how crosswinds might hamper the shot. If it was a night operation, I needed to know what lunar illumination we should expect. There might well be a full moon, but if there was heavy cloud cover, little light would filter through. Conversely, there might be too much light, causing human forms to cast shadows&#x2014;making us visible and vulnerable to ambush.<br> <br>If I ever felt the weather picture made a mission look undoable, I&#x2019;d make that known to my commanders. My final call&#x2014;the weather call&#x2014;would be made four to six hours ahead of the mission start time, which was just what I&#x2019;d done today, here in Ecuador. For weeks prior to the mission, I&#x2019;d studied the local weather patterns. Our area of operations sat right on the equatorial trough, a tropical storm corridor running along the equator. Weatherwise, it was a hugely volatile region. I&#x2019;d already inserted two combat weather guys around a hundred kilometers east of our target. As the weather blew in from that direction, they would be our eyes and ears, warning us of whatever was coming. Trained climatic observers, they&#x2019;d transmit key data: wind direction and speed, air temperature, cloud types and height, and dew point. The dew point is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with moisture, so fog or rain will form, impacting on visibility. They&#x2019;d warn us if cumulus cloud was incoming, since it tends to build rapidly into violent tropical storms.<br> <br>It was largely by using their data that I&#x2019;d been able to green-light today&#x2019;s mission. But once we were on the ground, I&#x2019;d carry on monitoring the weather every step of the way. Stuffed into my rucksack were the specialist tools of my trade, chiefly a portable combat weather laptop via which I could acquire my own data on the weather above us or download stats from the Skiff.<br> <br>The area we were flying into was heavily mountainous. We had hundreds of millions of dollars&#x2019; worth of equipment in the air with us, plus several dozen men-at-arms. There were thunderstorms every day over the Cordillera Central, and a bad downdraft could cause an aircraft to fall out of the sky or scatter injured parachutists across a wide swath of terrain.<br> <br>That was why I bore such a heavy responsibility for the present mission.<br> <br>By now, the SOAR guys had pretty much come to trust my decisions. A while back we&#x2019;d been on a training exercise in Kentucky. I&#x2019;d been on the ground with an advance force of SOAR operators, preparing to call in the main drop. But the area had been hit by a series of tornadoes, and for a while it had looked like the exercise was a no-go. Then a narrow weather window had opened and I&#x2019;d called the aircraft in. We&#x2019;d driven out to mark the landing zone so the parachutists would know exactly where to put down. We were halfway to the LZ when the heavens opened&#x2014;massive hailstones. The inbound aircraft were close now, and unless I called it off, we risked having parachutists jumping out of the skies into a hellish hailstorm.<br> <br>As the hailstones had pounded onto the roof of our vehicle, I&#x2019;d felt the SOAR guys staring at me and known what they were thinking: How the hell did he get it so wrong? No doubt about it, I was sweating it big-time. But I stuck with my gut instinct. The weather window was coming.<br> <br>The jump remained on.<br> <br>Sure enough, the hail had stopped, we&#x2019;d gotten the parachutists in, and the last set of boots had barely hit the ground when the weather window closed again. It had all been down...</p><h2>TIMETABLES OF WOMEN&#39;S HISTORY: A Chronology of the Most Important People and Events in Women&#39;s History</h2><p>Documents the accomplishments of women from earliest times to the present, including the first Japanese ruler in A.D. 190 and the first female rabbi in 1972</p><p>Karen Greenspan is an assistant professor of English at Skidmore College.This latest in Simon &amp; Schuster's Timetables series (<i>Timetables of History</i>, <i>Timetables of American History</i>, <i>Timetables of Jewish History</i>, <i>Timetables of Science</i>) lists thousands of entries in parallel columns.

Caesar must fight his toughest battle yet - with Rome itself. Julius Caesar, fresh from triumph in Britain and Gaul, is marching on Rome with his legions of hardened veterans. His goal: to unseat Pompey, now dictator of the Empire. But waging war on your own people is never easy. And even after the city itself is taken and Julius, Brutus, Mark Antony and Octavian re-enter in triumph, there are many battles left to fight. For across the Empire - in Spain, Africa, Greece, across Asia Minor - there are legions loyal to Pompey. How will Caesar prevail? And at what cost? `The Gods of War&#39; is the story of ambition and loyalty, of friendship and power, of love and war. A famous tale, of truly epic dimensions, it ranges from Rome to Greece to Egypt and back to Rome; it shows how brilliant generalship can completely turn the odds, how overwhelming success can change even the best of men; it depicts brilliantly those famous names - Caesar, Marcus Brutus, Mark Antony, Pompey, Cicero, Cleopatra, Ptolemy - so that they appear anew. This is a triumphant conclusion to the outstanding Emperor series.</p><p></p><h2>What Are You?: Voices of Mixed-Race Young People</h2><p>In the past three decades, the number of interracial marriages in the United States has increased by more than 800 percent. Now over four million children and teenagers do not identify themselves as being just one race or another.<br><br>Here is a book that allows these young people to speak in their own voices about their own lives.<br><br><i>What Are You?</i> is based on the interviews the author has made over the past two years with mixed-race young people around the country. These fresh voices explore issues and topics such as dating, families, and the double prejudice and double insight that come from being mixed, but not mixed-up.<br></p><p>Pearl Fuyo Gaskins is an award-winning journalist whose articles frequently appear in <i>Scholastic Choices</i> magazine. The child of an interracial marriage, she wrote What Are You? "to be a forum for mixed-race young people to share their experiences and validate their feelings." This is her first book. Ms. Gaskins grew up in California, lived in Hawaii, and now resides with her husband in West Orange, New Jersey.<br>"In the eyes of many people I am the product of a relationship that wasn't supposed to happen." "I'm no tragedy, and no exotic other." "I'm no jungle-fever rainbow baby." The contemporary voices are disturbing, frank, witty, and heartfelt. In essay, interview, and poetry, 45 mixed-race young people between the ages of 14 and 26, from all over the U.S., speak about their growing up. Whether black and white, white and Asian, Hispanic and black, Jewish and black, or whatever, each one is intensely personal; yet each one speaks to universals of coming-of-age as an outsider who doesn't fit into accepted categories. You read one piece, and it seems to say it all; turn to the next young person, and there is more surprise and drama. As with all authentic writing, the closer you get, the more diversity you see, and the more connections. Some speak of shame, some of pride; most have experienced both, in school and community, in their own families, in their individual searches for roots and love. Gaskins is a journalist for a teen educational magazine and is herself of mixed race. She allows the young people to speak for themselves, but she adds brief commentary where necessary as well as an excellent overview, and the insights of historians, therapists, and other experts. She applauds the recent revolutionary change that allows people to check more than one racial category on federal forms. The extensive annotated list of resources--including books, movies, Web sites, and advocacy groups--adds to the value of this landmark book. Read this with Bell's novel <i>Zack</i>, reviewed on p.1689, about one boy's search for his family roots, and with Nash's <i>Forbidden Love</i>, p.1687, for a view of American history through the lens of race. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Stranger in the House</h2><p>Eleven years after her young son mysteriously disappeared, Paul is miraculously returned, but Anna Lange and her family find their joy taking a dark turn because of Paul&#39;s odd behavior and by someone who will do anything to keep the truth a secret.

The sun streamed in on them, and a breeze from the open doors riffled the leaves of the plants. </p><p> Iris nodded. "Henry brought it in this morning." </p><p> "I always mean to put some in my garden, and then I forget." </p><p> "I'll tell Henry to dig some up for you," Iris said eagerly. </p><p> "Would you? That would be great." </p><p> Iris and Anna relaxed in their chairs, enjoying the sun and the breeze. Anna leaned over the glass table and picked up a pile of envelopes that were lying beside the bowl, addressed in Iris's careful hand. "What are you up to here?" Anna asked. </p><p> A pained look crossed Iris's face. "Oh, we're giving a party. For the Hospital Guild. It's going to be rather a large affair, to raise money for the new cardiac wing." </p><p> Anna nodded. "I read about it in the paper. I didn't know the party was going to be here." </p><p> "Well, Edward is the chairman of the fund-raising committee, you know." </p><p> Anna nodded, noting that Iris was clenching her hands together in her lap. "You're good at organizing things," Anna reassured her. "It will be a great success." </p><p> Iris gave a small sigh. "I hope so," she said. "There's one for you in there." Iris pointed to the stack of envelopes. </p><p> Anna found the envelope addressed to the Langes and smiled. "Tracy, too?" </p><p> "Older children." Iris shrugged. "That was my idea, I thought they'd pep things up." </p><p> "Great," said Anna. "When's the party going to be?" </p><p> "A week from tomorrow. The thirtieth. I hope you're free. I'm a little late with the invitations." </p><p> "The thirtieth," said Anna softly, staring down into her glass of tea. "That's Paul's birthday." She looked up at Iris. "He'll be fifteen this year." </p><p> Iris's eyebrows rose slightly. For a moment she regarded her friend thoughtfully. "Is that so?" she murmured. "Well...that's good. Where's Tom today?" </p><p> "With Tracy. They're playing tennis. Is Edward home?" </p><p> "Oh, no. He had a business lunch today. He just bought another company. The Wilcox Company, I think it's called. They have something to do with helicopter parts." </p><p> Anna stirred the ice in her glass and looked up under her eyelashes at Iris. You would never know to look at her, Anna thought, that her husband was a millionaire. Edward, whose company manufactured private aircraft, was always a model of correctness and elegance in his appearance, while Iris dressed simply and seemed to give only the minimum attention to her hair and makeup. </p><p> Nonetheless, they seemed to get along together, and Anna had always ascribed it to opposites attracting. </p><p> "Well, I've got to be getting back." She placed her empty glass down on the end table and got up. </p><p> "Anna, I meant to ask you. How's Tracy's job at the vet's working out?" </p><p> Anna frowned, thinking of her daughter. "Oh, she loves being around the animals. She doesn't get paid for it, but she seems to enjoy it." </p><p> "There, you see! That's great," said Iris. "I had a feeling that all she needed was an interest." </p><p> "It's helped," said Anna absently, although she felt a twinge of annoyance at Iris's simplistic solution to the problems she had with Tracy. Her shy, introverted daughter was turning into a moody, difficult teenager who seemed to resent her mother more each day. But Iris always acted as if a little change in the routine would solve everything. And perhaps in Iris's pampered, childless life, that was all the solution she needed, Anna thought ruefully. </p><p> "Why don't I ask Henry to get you those mint plants right now?" Iris suggested, opening the glass door to hail the gardener in a straw hat, who was crouching in a flowerbed beyond the pool. Anna realized that she had been unconsciously staring at him. </p><p> "No, no," she protested hurriedly. "Don't bother him." </p><p> "It's no bother," Iris insisted. </p><p> Anna shook her head but smiled at her friend's kindness. She felt guilty for her uncharitable thoughts about Iris, remembering how often she had taken comfort in Iris's confidence in Anna's ability to make things right. Often, when she had been down, it was a visit from Iris that had forced her up. She gave her friend a brief impulsive hug. "Not today," she said. "I'd better be getting along." </p><p> "If you have to," said Iris. "Don't forget. Put that party on your calendar." </p><p> "I will," said Anna. She walked out the door and down the steps, then headed down the incline past the pool, greeting Henry, the gardener, as she went by. Her route home through the Stewart estate was long and meandering but it was a walk she always enjoyed. She followed the path through the gardens, skirted the frog pond, and wandered in the grape arbors until she came to the high hedges and the narrow stream that separated their properties. </p><p> Anna decided, before she went in the house, to get a few vegetables from her garden for dinner. She was proud of her garden this year. She had culled a few tips from Henry and had raised a bountiful crop of vegetables. Everything had grown vigorously, probably because much of the garden plot had lain fallow for so many years. After harvesting two lustrous inky eggplants, a few tomatoes and a bunch of beans, Anna headed back toward the house. Sometimes, especially when the fall came, and Tracy returned to school, Anna thought about going back to work. She always decided against it, although she never admitted her real reason to Thomas. She wanted to be home, just in case. Just on the unlikely chance that Paul found his way back to them, she wanted to be there. Anna walked past the spot where the children's play yard had been. She stopped and sank down on the rusty glider, staring dully at the patch of lawn. It was green now and planted over with flowers. I'd better not mention Paul's birthday, she thought. Tom will only get upset. </p><p> She knew how much he didn't like to talk about it. But each year she felt compelled to bring it up, as if it were somehow vital that his parents speak his name aloud, acknowledge his birth. Every year Thomas would turn away from her with a grim look on his face. She didn't do it to pain him. It just seemed that it was important. Then, last year, when she mentioned it, he had suddenly gotten angry. </p><p> "Anna, I can't stand it when you say that. Every year it's the same thing. 'Paul is eleven today. Paul is twelve today. It's Paul's thirteenth birthday.' Why do you always have to mention it?" </p><p> "Because it is his birthday," she insisted. "Because I want to remember it." </p><p> "It's like some grisly joke. Paul's birthday. As if he were still alive and about to walk in that door." </p><p> "But, Tom," she protested, "I do believe that he is alive. Don't you? I mean, we don't know any different. We need to have hope, darling." </p><p> But Thomas had turned away from her without another word, and the subject was closed between them once again, as it had been for most of the years since Paul was gone. She could not pinpoint the time when they had stopped discussing it. But the child's disappearance had been like an amputation on the body of their marriage. Tom wanted to cover it, to hide it and pretend it hadn't happened. Or so it seemed to Anna, as she restlessly sought help, advice, some reassurance that she would one day reattach what seemed irretrievably lost. As if by agreement, they avoided talking about it. It was the best they could do. </p><p> Anna examined the ground from her seat on the glider, to see if any trace remained of the play fence, any faint outline of where it had been. The grass had grown over it. There was not a sign. It was as if it had never existed. </p><p> Anna walked up to the back porch and entered the cool, quiet house. She placed the basket on the butcher block beside the sink and turned on the tap, placing a copper colander into the clean porcelain basin. The only sound in the house was the rush of the running water. Normally she liked nothing better than to be busy in her comfortable kitchen, but now a melancholy mood descended on her. She held her wrist under the water, like a mother testing a baby's formula, and gazed over the plants on her windowsill into the stillness of the sun-dappled backyard. </p><p> Suddenly she became aware of a sound like tapping. Turning off the water, she listened again. Someone was knocking at the front door. After wiping her hands off quickly on the soft terry towel next to the sink, she hurried through the house to the foyer and opened the door. At first she saw no one there. Stepping out onto the front porch, she observed the familiar back of a man descending the flagstone steps to the driveway where his car was parked. </p><p> "Buddy," she called out, "come back. I'm here." </p><p> Detective Mario Ferraro started and then turned slowly around to face the woman standing in the doorway. She was smiling in welcome. Over the years he had come to know her well. Long after Paul's case had been officially abandoned, she'd continued to call him with questions about psychics or other missing children or any case that bore any similarity to her own. He had responded with what he hoped was patience and care to each of her desperate hopes, tracking down any fillip of a lead that came his way. "It's that poor woman again," a rookie named Parker told him the last time she had called with news of a child who had turned up in Houston. That poor woman. </p><p> He knew that was how the others saw her, but secretly he admired her courage and her tenacity. After losing her son and then the baby, she had pulled herself together and committed herself to the search. Some people thought it was abnormal, but Buddy saw the logic in her efforts. But for the grace of God, he had reminded himself often, he would have had to make such a choice as hers. He had decided to help her. One night Thomas had taken him aside in the kitchen and apologized to him for Anna's relentless questions and leads. </p><p> "There's no getting through to her," Thomas had said. In a way Thomas's reaction had bothered him more than Anna's. But he'd held his tongue. "I don't mind," he'd told Thomas. "I can imagine what she's going through." </p><p> "What's the matter with you?" Anna asked, squinting at him. "You look kind of sick." </p><p> Buddy Ferraro smiled with one corner of his mouth. "I'm glad you're here." </p><p> "I was out in the garden. I didn't hear your car come in. I hope you haven't been standing here for long." </p><p> The detective shook his head. Buddy climbed the steps haltingly. When he reached the porch where Anna stood, he looked at her and frowned, pressing his lips together. Anna linked her arm through his and led him into the house. "My garden," she said, "is really terrific this year. I've got something for you to take to Sandra. Eggplants and tomatoes. You get that wife of yours to make you eggplant Parmesan. No excuses. I'll give you a big bagful to take home." </p><p> "Anna..." he began. </p><p> Arm in arm they had passed through the foyer and into the bright L-shaped living room, which was filled with flowers, baskets of magazines, and needlepoint pillows on the furniture. Anna released the detective's arm and gestured toward a chair next to the fireplace at the end of the room. "Please sit down," she insisted. "I haven't seen you in such a long time now. I'm glad you came by. I was just in there starting to feel sorry for myself." She moved her knitting bag off the chair matching his and sat down opposite him. </p><p> Buddy perched on the edge of the seat and leaned forward. </p><p> "Can I get you something to drink? Club soda or a beer?" </p><p> The policeman shook his head. "It's good to see you," he said quietly. "But this isn't just a friendly visit. I have some news for you." </p><p> Anna gasped as if he had slapped her. Over the years she had been like a disappointed lover, waiting for a missive that never came. In time she had grown to expect the postman, not the letter. Now, suddenly, the detective was turning it all around. She stared into his eyes, trying to read what the message might be. </p><p> "Is Thomas home?" he asked quietly. "I think he should be here." </p><p> "He's not...he's out," she whispered, her eyes riveted to the detective's face. </p><p> Buddy Ferraro frowned. "Maybe we should..." </p><p> "It's Paul," she said. She clasped her hands together and pressed them to her lips. "Tell me," she whispered. </p><p> Buddy nodded and cleared his throat. "Anna," he said, "I don't know how to say this. It's going to be a shock." </p><p> Anna began to shake her head as she stared at him. </p><p> Buddy hesitated. "Paul's been found. He's alive." </p><p> Anna crushed her trembling fists to her mouth and squeezed her eyes shut for a moment. His words hung in the air before her, waiting for her to comprehend them. But a tingling fear suffused her, paralyzing her. She felt that if she tried to grasp what he said, take hold of it, it would somehow be snatched away from her. All hope, everything she had prayed for and clung to for all these years would vanish instantly and forever. "Don't lie to me, Buddy," she warned him in a shaking, nearly inaudible voice. </p><p> "I wouldn't, Anna. You know that. It's true. You can believe it. He's alive." Buddy was surprised by the tears that sprang to his own eyes. He pressed his lips into a crooked smile. </p><p> Anna sat frozen in her chair for a moment. Then, slowly, as if in a trance, she slid from the seat to her knees on the floor, clutching her arms around her chest. Her head was bowed; her eyes were shut. </p><p> Buddy sprang forward from his seat, prepared to grab her, thinking at first that she had fainted. Then, understanding, he exhaled and sat back in his chair. Bowing his head, he crossed himself quickly. </p><p> When Anna raised her head, her face was like a flower opening, turning out fragile petals one by one. </p><p> Buddy offered her his hand. Anna reached for it and kneaded it between her icy fingers. "Tell me everything," she whispered in a choked voice. "Where is he? Is he all right? Is he safe?" </p><p> "He's fine," Buddy assured her and reached into his pocket, removing his handkerchief and handing it to her. "Here." </p><p> While Anna wiped her eyes, the detective began to explain. "It happened this morning. We got a call from the sheriff of Hawley, West Virginia. He had been contacted by a minister in town who had evidence that Paul has been living all these years in that town as the son of a couple named Albert and Dorothy Lee Rambo. It seems that the woman was dying of cancer, and last week she contacted this minister, one Reverend Orestes Foster, and gave him a letter. Told him to open it at the time of her death, which occurred day before yesterday. The letter amounted to a confession that she and her husband had abducted Paul and raised him as their own son, and it also revealed Paul's identity, which apparently they were aware of all along." </p><p> "You're sure it's Paul." </p><p> Buddy nodded. "It's your boy all right. She still had the little clothes he was wearing when they took him. Pictures of him. The works. Evidently the woman...</p></p><h2>Growing Up With Quilts: 15 Projects For Babies To Teens</h2><p>No matter their age, no matter their style--every kid needs a quilt!

Sayers, G.K. Chesterton and nine other writers from the legendary Detection Club collaborate in this fiendishly clever but forgotten crime novel first published 80 years ago. Inspector Rudge does not encounter many cases of murder in the sleepy seaside town of Whynmouth. But when an old sailor lands a rowing boat containing a fresh corpse with a stab wound to the chest, the Inspector&#39;s investigation immediately comes up against several obstacles. The vicar, whose boat the body was found in, is clearly withholding information, and the victim&#39;s niece has disappeared. There is clearly more to this case than meets the eye -- even the identity of the victim is called into doubt. Inspector Rudge begins to wonder just how many people have contributed to this extraordinary crime and whether he will ever unravel it! In 1931, Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers and ten other crime writers from the newly-formed &#39;Detection Club&#39; collaborated in publishing a unique crime novel. In a literary game of consequences, each author would write one chapter, leaving G.K. Chesterton to write a typically paradoxical prologue and Anthony Berkeley to tie up all the loose ends. In addition, each of the authors provided their own solution in a sealed envelope, all of which appeared at the end of the book, with Agatha Christie&#39;s ingenious conclusion acknowledged at the time to be &#39;enough to make the book worth buying on its own&#39;. The authors of this novel are: G. K. Chesterton, Canon Victor Whitechurch, G. D. H. Cole and Margaret Cole, Henry Wade, Agatha Christie, John Rhode, Milward Kennedy, Dorothy L.

The author of more than fifty novels, she makes her home in Spokane, Washington.</p>Despite a few brief, shining moments, Cherryh's (Foreigner) new fantasy novel (her latest SF novel is reviewed below) proves an overwrought concoction. After a moderately interesting foray involving Mauryl, the aging wizard who conjures a "Shaping" named Tristen, the meandering of the nearly empty-headed Shaping takes center stage for far too long. Tristen sets off upon a quest knowing neither who he is nor what he seeks. Fortuitous happenings eventually bring him to Cefwyn, a prince in line to rule the land, and to Cefwyn's wizard, Emuin, himself a former student of Mauryl's. (The villains here are of two types: nebulously motivated men and erotically minded women.) A series of escapades involving prosaically presented political machinations leads to an inevitable final battle?and to the likelihood of a sequel. Several plot threads, such as Tristen's similarity to a golem and an invocation of the "Thirty-Eight," indicate that Cherryh is leaning on texts of Jewish mysticism here, but it's unlikely that even the most diligent of kabbalists would have the patience to wade through this substandard work. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dawn&#39;s Prelude (Song of Alaska)</h2><p>When newly widowed Lydia Sellers discovers that she is the sole recipient of her husband&#39;s fortune, her adult stepchildren battle to regain the inheritance for themselves, and, determined to put the memories of a painful past behind her, Lydia travels to join her aunt in Alaska, where the unexpected awaits her.

But instead of granting her security, strife ensues as her adult stepchildren battle to regain the inheritance for themselves. Lydia longs to wash her hands of the situation and determines to join her aunt in Alaska, putting financial decisions in the capable hands of her lawyer. The beauty and serenity of life in Sitka appeal to Lydia, as does Kjell Lindquist, the handsome owner of the local sawmill. But a new discovery in Lydia&#39;s life forces her to rethink her future. She is bound to her past as never before...but what more must she sacrifice?When Lydia Gray suddenly finds herself a widow, she discovers a newfound freedom she&#39;d never anticipated.

His mother tells stories of a ghost and a werewolf. Father tells of a vampire. Grandmother relates a tale of a ghost child. The last story, one that the child has written, conveys to parents the need to pay attention to their children. The five stories, each told in the first person, are a good blend of the type of horror that delights children. The stories are woven together, and brought to an end, by the appearance of a new visitor to the sick bed. The result is a good roller-coaster ride from the scary to the mundane and back again. This welcome addition will be ideal for reading aloud because the stories can be read singularly or as a whole. Teachers can also use the book effectively for storytelling, book talking, and creative writing assignments. The large print, easy vocabulary, and appealing subject matter make it a good choice for reluctant readers. The descriptions of the characters are excellent, giving a clear picture of each. Pen-and-ink illustrations interspersed throughout enhance the text. There are a few oddities in the translation from the German, but not enough to take anything away from the book. Although it probably won't be as popular as Schwartz' Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (Harper, 1981), this book will certainly hold its own in most collections. --Molly Kinney, North Dade Regional Library, Miami, <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Disraeli</h2><p>A documented biography of the 19th century statesman which recreates the political history of the Victorian age</p><p><i><b>Robert Blake</b></i> (1916-2003) was the pre-eminent Tory historian of his day.

But, as society matures, so must liberalism as it reaches out to redefine itself in a world where government must play a role in creating an environment in which citizens can achieve their potential. Dewey&#39;s advocacy of a positive role for government - a new liberalism - nevertheless finds him rejecting radical Marxists and fascists who would use violence and revolution rather than democratic methods to aid the citizenry.</p><p>John Dewey (1859-1952) authored more than two dozen books and scores of articles in both scholarly and popular publications.

For centuries they have yearned for official statehood&#x2015;and now, as one of the accidental outcomes of the invasion, the United States may have helped them take a big step toward that goal. Informed by his deep knowledge of the people and region, Quil Lawrence's intimate and unflinching portrait of the Kurds and their heretofore quixotic quest offers a vital and original lens through which to contemplate the future of Iraq and the surrounding Middle East.</p></p><p><p><b>Quil Lawrence </b>is the Middle East correspondent for BBC/ PRI's <i>The World</i>, and has spent much of the last seven years in Iraq and Kurdistan. He has reported for National Public Radio, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, and has won awards for his reporting from Colombia, Sudan, and Iraq. This is his first book.</p><p>&#x201c;A fine journalistic account of the personalities that animate the northern third of the country. They are all canny operators. Lawrence tells the story of Gen. Jay Garner's meeting with Jalal Talabani in 1991, when the latter (now president of the Republic of Iraq) was a guerilla scampering through the mountains to avoid Saddam. Shocked by Talabani's awareness of the war in areas well beyond his redoubt, Garner asked him his intelligence sources. Talabani showed Garner a room of electronics, as fancy as the general's own, and said he talked with John Major twice a day. This is the enigma of the Kurdish leadership in miniature: they are hardier than mountain goats and slicker than lobbyists. Lawrence's book captures both registers, as well as many in between.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Graeme Wood , The Atlantic</i></p><p>&#x201c;Extensively researched and footnoted, yet readable and often engaging, "Invisible Nation" guides the reader through the "luckless history" of the Kurds.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Matthew B.

Drawing on his intimate, on-the-ground knowledge of Kurdistan, Lawrence exposes us to the little-known history of the Kurdish people, their epic struggle for survival and self-governance, and their crucial role in the new Iraq. A fascinating and compelling tale, it's a valuable addition to the bookself for anyone who cares about what's happening in Iraq.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rajiv Chandrasekaran, author of Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone</i></p><p>&#x201c;The quest for Kurdish statehood is, in part, a story of unintended consequences, a sweeping narrative that Quil Lawrence masterfully charts with insight, authority and, perhaps most important, compassion. His book is a story not only of Kurdistan, but of Iraq, of the Middle East and of the future. To understand any of those, this book is essential. <i>Invisible Nation</i> stands as one of the most important works to emerge from a war that, five years in, remains as unpredictable as when it first started, a point that Lawrence makes abundantly clear.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Anthony Shadid, Pulitzer Prize winner and author of Night Draws Near: Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's War</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this dramatic narrative, Quil Lawrence has untwined one of the most tangled histories of the Middle East and made it comprehensible. <i>Invisible Nation</i> is a riveting account of Iraq's Kurds and their essential role in the reshaping of modern Iraq. For anyone wishing to understand how the Kurds' quest for nationhood plays into the ongoing U.S. war in Iraq, this book is a must-read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life and The Fall of Baghdad</i></p></p><h2>The Healthy Mind, Healthy Body Handbook</h2><p>A valuable new kind of prescription for health and well being.

Bryn Hammond reveals that the narrative that emerged from this legendary battle was mostly a myth. The initial British successes were due to brilliant innovations in artillery, not tanks and tanks weren&#x2019;t enough to keep the Germans from re-capturing their losses. But in this account of Cambrai, the first to appear in four decades, Hammond shows how generals and politicians seduced by the tank&#x2019;s mythical abilities poured resources into creating a more mobile army in the following decades. By World War II, the tank would live up to its legend.</p><p>Dr Bryn Hammond is a member of the Centre for First World War Studies, the British Commission for Military History and the Western Front and Gallipoli Associations. He is also joint convenor of the Imperial War Museum&#39;s History Group. He has written numerous articles about the First World War, and is a regular speaker on the subject.

In a forgotten valley on the Devon-Somerset border, the seasons unfold, marked only by the rituals of the farming calendar. Twelve-year-old Leopold Sercombe skips school to help his father, a carter. Skinny and pale, Leo dreams of a job on the estate&#39;s stud farm. He is breaking a colt for his father when a boy dressed in a Homburg, breeches and riding boots appears. Peering under the stranger&#39;s hat, he discovers Miss Charlotte, the Master&#39;s daughter. And so begins a friendship between the children, bound by a deep love of horses, but divided by rigid social boundaries - boundaries that become increasingly difficult to navigate as they approach adolescence.</p><p>Tim Pears is the author of eight novels: In the Light of Morning, In the Place of Fallen Leaves (winner of the Hawthornden Prize and the Ruth Hadden Memorial Award), Wake Up, Blenheim Orchard, In a Land of Plenty (made into a ten-part BBC series), A Revolution of the Sun, Landed (shortlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award 2012 and the 2011 Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje Prize, winner of the MJA Open Book Awards 2011), and Disputed Land.

Pears&#39;s fiction has been likened to Thomas Hardy&#39;s, and the comparison is apposite. As a coming-of-age novel, The Horseman is wise and insightful. As a love story, it is moving and sincere. And as a portrayal of rural Edwardian England, it is powerful, vivid and humane * Observer * Pears has often been praised for his strong, clear prose and his ability to tell fascinating stories without fuss or fanfare. The Horseman is his best work in many years. As a testament to a forgotten generation of countrymen it is unsurpassed * The Times * The pleasure of it lies in taking in the language and the setting - the West country, in 1911 and 1912 - and in reading it like a long poem, with each chapter a stanza ... The natural world is sometimes antagonistic, sometimes beautiful, but always alive with detail ... I am ready for volume two -- Jane Smiley * Guardian * With hypnotic lyricism, Pears describes this bucolic Devon world and the people who inhabit it ... [A] paean to the pastoral * Mail on Sunday * A mesmerising book ... An evocation of the pre-First World War countryside, sparely written and imagined with exceptional fidelity -- Clive Aslet * Country Life * The most entrancing novel I read this year is The Horseman by Tim Pears. This intelligent and moving evocation of life on a country estate just before the First World War is both down-to-earth and magical -- Allan Massie * Sunday Herald, Books of the Year * This book needs to be read with quiet attention to reap its rich rewards -- John Harding * Daily Mail * An assured, slow-burn, lyrical book, a rewarding read in our troubled times. Once again Pears celebrates growing up, the trials of family life and the beauty and wildness of untamed nature, offering fascinating insights into the consolations as well as the cruelties of rural life -- Jackie McGlone * Herald * A beautiful portrait of rural life at the turn of the century ... Tim Pears combines meticulously researched historical material ... all depicted in rich, evocative detail - with lush, languorous, melodic prose ... A distinctly compelling pastoral bildungsroman that leaves the reader eager for the next installment * BBC Countryfile * Evocative of Hardy ... The Horseman is itself an exhilarating vision, a bittersweet elegy for the innocent certainties of an agrarian world before the industrialised horrors of the 20th century come crashing down * Irish Times * A magnificent novel. In spare yet elegant precise prose Tim Pears offers entrance into a place and characters otherwise lost to time ... Leo Sercombe is one of the most engaging creations to come along in fiction in a long time and I eagerly look forward to following his life in future tellings.

From beginning to end some of these poems chart the journey that is life and one woman&#39;s cycle of dependency as she recovers her lost identity. Thematically, it is bound by a writer&#39;s search for love and fight for freedom, drawing on the spirit and will of Harriet Tubman, the image of the bloated body of Emmett Till, the bombing of Philadelphia Move, and lesbian love. In the tradition of June Jordan and Sapphire, Pamela Sneed presents an in-your-face, powerful, and stirring debut.</p><p><br>Pamela Sneed, a New York-based performance poet, has graced the cover of <i>New York </i>magazine and was featured in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>. She has performed at Lincoln Center, The Whitney Museum of Art, and in Berlin, Vienna, and London.<br><br>paper 0-8050-5474-X The poetically inept and politically inane rantings of performance artist Sneed would escape notice but for mainstream publishings cravenly bringing her meager verse to the market and exploiting the anger and confusion of the self-styled revolutionary lesbian poet. Sneed's first book proves that whatever may have been powerful as chanted on the stage is sloppy and facile on the page. Shamed by her suburban hang-ups, Sneed cultivates ``a kick-ass spirit'' and shouts out to all thoselovers, teachers, fatherwho ``UNDERESTIMATED'' her ``POWER.'' She identifies with ``abused'' kids, bemoans ``shackling poverty'' and ``unfeministic jealousy.'' Her political martyrology is a confusion of images from Harriet Tubman to the group rapists in Central Park. Years of therapy reveal that ``psychotherapy is. . . a capitalist tool.'' The poets confusion of politics and pathology leads eventually to the insight that ``the real revolution/is changing myself.'' Underneath it all runs a sad plea for acceptance of the love she offers, and, less appealingly, an amazing desire for literary prizes and big saleswhich just might come to pass, as Sneeds irresponsible publishers no doubt are gambling. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He shook his head, frustrated and amused. After twenty-three years of marriage he knew the futility of trying to hurry his wife when she wasn&#39;t interested in being hurried. He sighed and glanced around the tiny shop, one of a hundred stalls squeezed next to each other inside Istanbul&#39;s Spice Bazaar. Every inch of floor space was covered and every shelf was filled with spilling bags and open barrels of nuts, candies, fruit, seeds, pods, stems, leaves---some fresh, some dried; some ground, some whole---more spices and herbs than he&#39;d ever seen or smelled in his life. The aromas were dizzying, as were the bazaar&#39;s sounds and colors. A menagerie of vendors beckoning the passing crowd to &#39;come, see my jewelry . . . perfume for your lady friend . . . a souvenir for your children . . . beautiful key chain to ward off evil eye ... finest gold in all Turkey . . . natural pirinc, good for much romance . . . Visa, Mastercard accepted . . . come, just to talk, we have some tea, my friend, just to talk.&#39; It was that last phrase that did them in yesterday. They&#39;d barely left the hotel lobby before a merchant was escorting them into one of the city&#39;s thousands of oriental rug shops. They&#39;d made it clear they were not buying. The rugs were beautiful but there was no room in their house nor their budget. The owner nodded in sym-pathetic understanding. But after two hours of chitchat, pictures of a brother who lived in America, and more than one glass of hot tea, they found themselves viewing his wares and feeling obligated to at least purchase something---which they did. Seven hundred and fifty dollars&#39; worth of something! But today was another day---he hoped. &#39;Jill . . .&#39; She nodded. She smiled. And she continued talking to the leather-faced shopkeeper. The bartering was good-natured. Jill had purchased a quarter kilo of halvah---a deadly rich concoction of ground sesame seed and honey. She&#39;d already paid for it, but before passing the bag to her, the old-timer tried to persuade her to buy more. &#39;I&#39;m afraid it will make me even fatter,&#39; she said, pretending to pat an imaginary belly. &#39;A woman of your beauty, she could eat a hundred kilo and it would make no difference.&#39; Jill laughed and the man threw Daniel a wink with his good eye, making it clear the flirting was all in fun. Daniel smiled back. It was obvious the fellow liked Jill. Then again, everyone liked Jill. The reason was simple. Everyone liked Jill because she liked everyone. From the crankiest congregation member to the most obnoxious telemarketer, his wife always found some-thing to like. And it wasn&#39;t a put-on. The sparkle in her eyes and delight in her voice was always genuine. Unlike Daniel, who had to work harder at his smiles and often thought his social skills were clunky, Jill was blessed with a spontaneous joy. And that joy was the light of his life. A day didn&#39;t go by that he didn&#39;t thank God for it--- even as high school sweethearts, she a cheerleader, he a tall, gangly second-stringer for the basketball team. He could never figure out what she saw in him, then . . . or now. But he never stopped being grateful that she did. As the years of marriage deepened their love, she had moved from someone who always touched his heart to someone who had become his heart. In many ways she had become his center, a constant point around which much of his life revolved. He cherished this woman. And though he seldom said it, her heart and love for others was a quiet challenge and model that he never ceased striving to emulate. Yes, her love for people was a great gift---except when they were on a tight schedule, as they were now, as they always seemed to be. Because no matter how friendly you are, it takes more than a sincere smile to keep a forty-five-hundred-member church afloat. &#39;Jill . . .&#39; He motioned to his watch, a Rolex. It had been presented to him by the elders for twenty years of faithful service. Twenty hard-fought years of sweating and building the church out of nothing. Originally he&#39;d hated the watch. Felt it was too flashy for a pastor. But because of the politics involved, he&#39;d forced him-self to wear it. You don&#39;t keep a forty-five-hundred-member church afloat without understanding politics. &#39;This I do for you,&#39; the shopkeeper was saying. His good eye briefly darted to someone or something behind them. &#39;I sell you one-quarter kilo and give you an extra quarter for free.&#39; &#39;No, no, no . . .&#39; Jill laughed, suspecting another ploy. &#39;Just one-quarter kilogram, that&#39;s all we need.&#39; &#39;No.&#39; The man&#39;s voice grew firm. &#39;I have made up my mind.&#39; &#39;But we only have enough to buy one-quarter.&#39; &#39;This I have heard.&#39; The shopkeeper spoke faster. He turned his back to them, momentarily blocking their view. &#39;But for you, I give a most special gift.&#39; When he turned to them, he was already wrapping it in the same slick, brown paper he had used before. &#39;Please,&#39; Jill said, laughing, &#39;you don&#39;t understand.&#39; Again the man&#39;s eye flickered to somewhere behind them. &#39;I understand everything,&#39; he said, forcing a chuckle. &#39;It is free. I make no joke.&#39; He dropped the item into the bag and handed it to her. &#39;But I can&#39;t. I mean, that is very generous, but I can&#39;t accept---&#39; &#39;You must,&#39; he said, smiling. &#39;It is the Turkish way.&#39; He glanced behind them and spoke even faster. &#39;It is an old Islamic custom.&#39;</p><h2>Light and the Glory, The: 1492-1793 (God&#39;s Plan for America)</h2><p>Now revised and expanded for the first time in more than thirty years, this classic will now be available for a new generation of readers.</p><p>Did Columbus believe that God called him west to undiscovered lands?

This book tells the story of their life together.</p><p>Dave Eggers is a terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him. What to make of a book called <i>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story</i>? For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even <i>get</i> to the true story, including a preface, a list of "Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book," and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special mail-in offer, flow chart of the book's themes, and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully labeled "Here is a drawing of a stapler:").<p> But on to the true story. At the age of 22, Eggers became both an orphan and a "single mother" when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers. In the ensuing sibling division of labor, Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. The two live together in semi-squalor, decaying food and sports equipment scattered about, while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities, molesting babysitters, and his own health. His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brother's upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him. (Case in point: his idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Hersey's <i>Hiroshima</i>.)</p><p> The book is also, perhaps less successfully, about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic, media-savvy, Gen-X way, naturally). In the early '90s, Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny <i>Might Magazine</i>, and he spends a fair amount of time here on <i>Might</i>, the hipster culture of San Francisco's South Park, and his own efforts to get on to MTV's <i>Real World</i>. This sort of thing doesn't age very well--but then, Eggers knows that. There's no criticism you can come up with that he hasn't put into <i>A.H.W.O.S.G.</i> already. "The book thereafter is kind of uneven," he tells us regarding the contents after page 109, and while that's true, it's still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and <i>interesting</i>. </p><p> All this self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch. It's a testament to Eggers's skill as a writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesn't. Currently the editor of the footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal <i>McSweeney's</i> (the last issue featured an entire story by David Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine), Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in history--so much so that he can't feel an emotion without the sense that it's already been felt <i>for</i> him. What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him. Oddly enough, the effect is one of complete sincerity, and--especially in its concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>"For 40 years readers have been waiting around on J. D. Salinger to send down a new manuscript from high atop his reclusive Vermont mountain. Well, the vigil is over and we can forget about hearing from Salinger. He's been replaced by a stunning new writer. His name is Dave Eggers." &#x2014;<i>Tampa Tribune<br></i><br>"Like any good trip, it's not the destination, but what's around the bend that counts. [And Eggers] takes us on a trip where he throws his hat out the window, rather than into the ring--to a place between autobiography and fiction, a place just off a bumpy road where truth is perhaps most comfortable. Exhilarating! Stunning! Heartbreaking! <i>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</i> amazes constantly." &#x2014;<i>The Globe and Mail<br></i><br>"Eggers unfailingly captures the reader with gorgeous conviction." &#x2014;Lynn Crosbie, <i>The Toronto Star<br></i><br>"A virtuosic piece of writing, a big, daring, manic-depressive stew of a book that noisily announces the debut of a talented &#x2014; yes, staggeringly talented &#x2014; new writer." &#x2014; Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times<br></i><br>"Scathingly perceptive and hysterically funny.... Eggers reveals a true, and truly broken, heart." &#x2014;<i>People</i><br><br>"Eggers crafts something universal here, something raw and real and wonderful that transcends any zeitgeist and manages to deal trenchantly with 'big issues' that often prove too daunting for younger writers: mortality, youth, the artifice of writing, the Zen of Frisbee. This is laugh-out-loud funny and utterly unforgettable." &#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i><br>"Eggers evokes the terrible beauty of youth like a young Bob Dylan, frothing with furious anger--. A comic and moving witness that transcends and transgresses formal boundaries." &#x2014;<i>Washington Post<br></i><br>"A brave work, and not a little heartbreaking." &#x2014;<i>National Post</i></p><h2>The Ultimate 5:2 Diet Recipe Book: Easy, Calorie Counted Fast Day Meals You&#39;ll Love</h2><p><p>The 5:2 Diet is transforming lives worldwide.

The arrival of tricolour cockades &#x2013;&nbsp;badges showing support for the French Revolution &#x2013; and news from Paris in 1789 undermined the royal governors&#x2019; authority, unleashed bitter conflict between white factions, and encouraged the aspirations of free people of colour to equality and black slaves to freedom. </p><br><p>This book provides a detailed narrative of the shifting political developments, and analyses the roles of planter resentment of metropolitan control, social and racial tensions, and the ambiguity of revolutionary principles in a colonial setting. Recent scholarship has tended to over-emphasize the colonies&#x2019; agency, and to accentuate the conflict between masters and slaves, while downplaying metropolitan influences. In contrast, this study seeks to restore the importance of destabilizing political struggles between white factions. It argues that metropolitan news, ideas, language, and political culture &#x2013;&nbsp;the "revolutionary script" from France &#x2013;&nbsp;played a key role in shaping the revolution in the colonies.</p></p><p><b>William S. Cormack</b> is an associate professor in the Department of History at the University of Guelph. <br><p>"<i>Patriots, Royalists, and Terrorists in the West Indies</i> is an impressive survey based on years of work in a wide range of archives. Events in the Caribbean have assumed increasing importance in the study of the French Revolution over the last generation, but most attention has always been given to Saint-Domingue and the origins of Haiti. This book will bring readers an important account of relatively neglected episodes on the history of the Revolution, of French colonialism, and the wider area of slavery."</p> (William Doyle, Emeritus Professor of History, University of Bristol, author of <em>The Oxford History of the French Revolution</em>)<br><br><p>"<i>Patriots, Royalists, and Terrorists in the West Indies</i> sheds badly needed light on the destabilizing political struggles between different white factions. The story of these fratricidal factional struggles which shattered the colonial status quo and created the opening for free people of color and then slaves to claim their rights, is essential, needed badly to be told, and is now laid out cogently and convincingly in this work."</p> (Rafe Blaufarb, Professor of History, Florida State University)</p><h2>Alfred Stieglitz&#39;s Camera Notes</h2><p><p><strong>This striking volume details the history of <em>Camera Notes</em>, the most significant and influential American photographic periodical of its time.</strong></p> Published quarterly by the Camera Club of New York and edited by Alfred Stieglitz, the fountainhead of American art photography, <em>Camera Notes</em> represented a critical phase in the campaign to legitimize the photo image as an artistic pursuit. Throughout most of its six-year life (1897-1903), the publication included thoughtful articles on photography and fine art as well as hundreds of halftone images and stunning high-quality photogravures. While much has been written on Stieglitz's life--including his later publication, <em>Camera Work</em>--little attention has been giving to <em>Camera Notes</em>.<br><br> All ninety-one of the beautiful photogravures that appeared during the journals life are reproduced here in their original tones. In addition, this volume contains a fully illustrated index of the more than 250 halftones that appeared on its pages.</p><p>Christian A. Peterson is associate curator of photography at the Minneapolis Institute of the Arts. He has authored monographs on the photographers Max Thorek and D. J. Ruzicka and wrote the catalog Camera Work: Process and Image. He lives in Minneapolis.<i>Camera Work</i> is the best-known journal Alfred Stieglitz, that self-proclaimed high priest of turn-of-the-century photography, edited, but he earlier guided the New York Camera Club's journal of record, <i>Camera Notes</i>, through most of its short life, 1897-1903. This volume's excellent account of that editorship follows Stieglitz as he lost patience with club members and, led by his elitist vision, dramatically resigned to found <i>Camera Work</i>. Well-produced and serious, <i>Camera Notes</i> was liberally illustrated with fine gravures and many more halftone reproductions, all of which appear here--the gravures as beautiful colorplates, the halftones in small reference illustrations. There are many visual crossovers between Stieglitz's two journals, for he never hesitated in using his own photographs as illustrations, and some were in both journals, as were those of a few of his favorites--Gertrude Kasebier, for instance. This excellent addition to the literature of photography accompanies an exhibition to be seen in Minneapolis, Wichita, Phoenix, Detroit, Huntington (W. Va.), and Washington, D.C. <i>Gretchen Garner</i></p><h2>Donald Duck and the magic stick (Disney&#39;s wonderful world of reading)</h2><p>With the help of his magic stick Louie retrieves Huey&#39;s magic table and Dewey&#39;s magic donkey and proves to Uncle Donald that there is such a thing as magic.</p><p></p><h2>Degas in Search of His Technique</h2><p>Looks at the various media Degas used, including oils, pastels, gouache, and etchings, and discusses his search for new techniques of expression</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Original Porsche 911: The Guide to All Production Models, 1963-98 (Original Series)</h2><p>The essential companion to this immortal sports car!

Were the Indians the result of a co-creation? Were they descended from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel? Could they have emigrated from Carthage, Phoenicia, or Troy? All these and many other theories were proposed.</p><p>How could scholars account for the multiplicity of languages among the Indians, the differences in levels of culture? And how did the Indian arrive in America&#x2014;by using as a bridge a now-lost continent or, as was later suggested by some persons in the light of an expanding knowledge of geography, by using the Bering Strait as a migratory route?</p><p>Most of the theories regarding the American Indian were first advanced in the sixteenth century. In this distinctive book Lee E. Huddleston looks carefully into those theories and proposals. From many research sources he weaves an historical account that engages the reader from the very first.</p><p>The two most influential men in an early-developing controversy over Indian origins were Joseph de Acosta and Gregorio Garc�a. Approaching the subject with restraint and with a critical eye, Acosta, in 1590, suggested that the presence of diverse animals in America indicated a land connection with the Old World. On the other hand, Garc�a accepted several theories as equally possible and presented each in the strongest possible light in his Origen de los indios of 1607.</p><p>The critical position of Acosta and the credulous stand of Garc�a were both developed in Spanish writing in the seventeenth century. The Acostans settled on an Asiatic derivation for the Indians; the Garcians continued to accept most sources as possible. The Garcian position triumphed in Spain, as was shown by the republication of Garc�a&#x2019;s Origen in 1729 with considerable additions consistent within the original framework.</p><p>Outside of Spain, Acosta was the more influential of the two. His writings were critical in the thinking of such men as Joannes de Laet (who bested Grotius in their polemic on Indian origins), Georg Horn, and Samuel Purchas. By the end of the seventeenth century the Acostans of Northern Europe had begun to apply physical characteristics to the determination of Indian origins, and by the early eighteenth century these new criteria were beginning to place the question of Indian origins on a more nearly scientific level.</p></p><p>Lee E.

In the United States it quickly became an institution that soon spread worldwide as a favorite form of popular culture.<br>What made the comic strip so enduring? This fascinating study by one of the few comics critics to develop sound critical principles by which to evaluate the comics as works of art and literature unfolds the history of the funnies and reveals the subtle art of how the comic strip blends words and pictures to make its impact. Together, these create meaning that neither conveys by itself. The Art of The Funnies offers a critical vocabulary for the appreciation of the newspaper comic strip as an art form and shows that full awareness of the artistry comes from considering both the verbal and the visual elements of the medium. The techniques of creating a comic strip - breaking down the narrative, composition of the panel, planning the layout - have remained constant since comic strips were originated.<br>Since 1900 with Winsor McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland key cartoonists have relied on the union of words and pictures to give the funnies their continuing appeal. This art has persisted in such milestone achievements as Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff, George McManus's Bringing Up Father, Sidney Smith's The Gumps, Roy Crane's Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy, Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie, Chester Gould's Dick Tracy, Zack Mosley's Smilin' Jack, Harold Foster's Tarzan, Alex Raymond's Secret Agent X-9, Jungle Jim, and Flash Gordon, Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates, E. C. Segar's Popeye, George Herriman's Krazy Kat, and Walt Kelly's Pogo. In more recent times with Mort Walker's Beetle Bailey, Charles Schulz's Peanuts. Johnny Hart's B.C., T.K. Ryan's Tumbleweeds, Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury, and Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes, the artform has evolved with new developments, yet the aesthetics of the funnies remain basic.<br>The Art of The Funnies unearths new information and weighs the influence of syndication upon the medium. Though the funnies go in ever new directions, perceiving the interdependency of words and pictures, as this book shows, remains the key to understanding the art.</p><p><p>Exploration of the comic strip for elements that make the funnies one of the most appealing of the popular arts</p><p>Robert C. Harvey, a comics historian and critic, is a cartoonist who writes for <i>The Comics Journal</i>, <i>Comics Buyers' Guide</i>, and <i>Cartoonist PROfiles</i>.

And new parents find themselves struggling to reconcile their elation with the often exhausting, confusing, and expensive business of child care.

You can see him thinking, &#x2018;That needs fixing&#x2019;, which is not the same thing at all as &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll fix that today&#x2019;, but which is very nearly the same as &#x2018;It&#x2019;ll never be fixed.&#x2019; Daily life is full of these small repeated astonishments, hopes (that it might somehow have fixed itself overnight) and resignations (it hasn&#x2019;t and won&#x2019;t). A tall man&#x2014;a customer!&#x2014;enters the bar, puts his knapsack under the table, the small round table you lean against while drinking. He&#x2019;s tall but not young, balding, obviously not a terrorist, and there&#x2019;s no way that his knapsack could contain a bomb, but this unremarkable action&#x2014;putting a knapsack under the table in a bar&#x2014;is not one that can now go unremarked, especially by someone who first saw <i>Stalker </i>(on Sunday, February 8, 1981) shortly after seeing <i>Battle of Algiers. </i>He orders something from the barman. The fact that the barman&#x2019;s jacket is white emphasizes how not terribly clean it is. Although it&#x2019;s a jacket it also serves as a towel, possibly as a dishcloth, and maybe as a hankie too. The whole place looks like it could be dirty but it&#x2019;s too dingy to tell and the credits in yellow Russian letters&#x2014;sci-fi Cyrillic&#x2014;do not exactly clarify the situation. <br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s the kind of bar men meet in prior to a bank job that is destined to go horribly wrong, and the barman is the type to take no notice of anything that&#x2019;s not his business and the more things that are not his business the better it is for him, even if it means that business is so slow as to be almost nonexistent. Far as he&#x2019;s concerned, long as he&#x2019;s here, minding his own business and wearing his grubby barman&#x2019;s jacket, he&#x2019;s doing his job, and if no one comes and no one wants anything and nothing needs doing (the wonky light can wait, as can most things) it&#x2019;s all the same to him. Still smoking, he trudges over with a coffeepot (he&#x2019;s one of those barmen who has the knack of imbuing the simplest task with grudge, making it feel like one of the labours of a minimum-wage Hercules), pours some coffee for the stranger, goes out back again and leaves him to it, to his coffee, to his sipping and waiting. Of that there can be no doubt: the stranger is defi nitely waiting for something or someone.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>A caption: some kind of meteorite or alien visitation has led to the creation of a miracle: the Zone.

Are they real? Folklorists say they are fragments of ancient religious beliefs; occultists call them nature spirits; the peasant tradition says they are fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved or bad enough to be lost. In his definitive study, W.Y. Evans-Wentz, the renowned translator of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, unveils the mystic and mysterious folklore of all the Celtic nations. This book presents a body of tradition of and testimony about an elusive order of life that survives in the natural setting of wild and lonely places. Not satisfied with merely formal study, Evans-Wentz collected firsthand reports of fairies in Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Brittany and sought to answer the key questions avoided by other folklorists. A classic in the field of Celtic studies, The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries presents evidence for living fairy faith that Dr. Wentz gathered in his travels; examines the recorded stories of fairies in classic works like the Welsh Mabinogion, and the Irish Tuatha de Danann, as well as Arthurian legends; explores belief in fairies; and studies the fairy faith in light of science. A compassionate, lively, and seminal exploration of a rich and luminous world, this is an unparalleled addition to the field of Celtic studies.</p><p>..&#34;.a very charming and valuable book.

Brazos Press is proud to present <i>With the Grain of the Universe: The Church's Witness and Natural Theology,</i> Hauerwas's distinguished Gifford lectures at the University of St. Andrews (2001).<br><br>These lectures explore how natural theology, divorced from a confessional doctrine of God, inevitably distorts our understanding of God's character and the world in which we live. Hauerwas criticizes those who use natural theology to defend theism as the philosophical prerequisite to confessional claims. Instead, after Karl Barth, he argues that natural theology should witness to "the non-Godforsakeness of the world, even under the conditions of sin."<br><br>Stanley Hauerwas has good news for the church: theology can still tell us something significant about the way things are. In fact, the church is more than a social institution, and the cross of Christ, never peripheral, is central to knowing God. Whatever our native moral intelligence, the truth that is God is not available apart from moral transformation. Ultimately--and despite the scars left by modernity--theology must translate into a life transformed by confession and the witness of the church.</p><p>More praise for <i>With the Grain of the Universe</i>, the Gifford Lectures at the University of St. Andrews (2001):<br><br>"An unexpectred threesome-William James, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Karl Barth-make for a surprising story and an original book. In Hauerwas's fresh interpretation of American intellectual history, Niebuhr the neo-orthodox theologian appears not as the Christian alternative to James's pragmatism,but as a thin religious version of the same, packaged in the vocabulary of Christian theology. Against this backdrop, Hauerwas draws on Karl Barth to set forth a 'theology without reservation' that takes modernity seriously but meets it not on modernity's terms but on the church's terms . . . This is a book we have long awaited: Hauerwas's account of what went wrong and what went right with theology in the twentieth century."<br>-Robert Louis Wilken, author of <i>The Christians As the Romans Saw Them </i>and <i>The Land Called Holy</i><br><br>"In its animated conversations with William James, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Karl Barth, and its constructive proposals, this book makes for fine reading and ought to stir up some new and serious debate about what the church's confession has to say about natural reality."<br>-John Webster, Oxford University<br><br>"Hauerwas offers a highly informed account of his claim that Karl Barth understood what . . . William James and Reinhold Niebuhr did not: that natural theology is intelligible only as part of the whole doctrine of God revealed in Christ. Whether or not one agrees with Hauerwas-I do not-this book will rightly set the agenda for future discussion about the sources and authorities by which 'natural theology' may proceed."<br>-Harlan Beckley, Washington and Lee University<br><b>Stanley Hauerwas</b> is Gilbert T. Rowe Professor of Theological Ethics at Duke University. He is a prolific author, with previous books including <i>Resident Aliens, A Community of Character, The Peaceable Kingdom, </i>and <i>A Better Hope</i>. Hauerwas has made signal contributions to three of the most influential developments in theology over the last thirty years: postliberalism, narrative theology, and virtue ethics. Vigorous and far-ranging in argument, he is perhaps the most quoted and debated theologian of our day."In this stunning book, the great Christian ethicist Stanley Hauerwas offers the comprehensive theological argument we have long requested. Of course, if we were worthier students, we would have known this could not come in the form of a conceptual system. Like Barth, whom he makes the hero of this book, Hauerwas teaches that Christian theological argument begins not with our own rational constructs, but by bearing witness to God's life among us. The argument proceeds not by speculating on what God's life might mean, but by narrating how it is in fact imitated by sanctified lives here in this created world. The argument ends not by framing doctrines, but by warning us of the error, violence, suffering, and death that remain in this world-and it calls us, in imitation of God's life, to help heal this world and to work for its final redemption. For those whose habit it is to call this world 'nature,' Hauerwas's theological argument may be dubbed 'natural theology,' and the consequence will be a radical change in what we take natural theology to be. Natural theology will be the story of God's life as it is lived, visibly, in this world; as its meaning is disclosed to the community of those who inquire after it, and as its truth is displayed through its visible effects in transforming this world into the one it would be and will be."<br>-Peter Ochs, University of Virginia</p><h2>Has Feminism Changed Science?</h2><p><p>Do women do science differently? And how about feminists--male or female? The answer to this fraught question, carefully set out in this provocative book, will startle and enlighten every faction in the "science wars."</p><p><i>Has Feminism Changed Science?</i> is at once a history of women in science and a frank assessment of the role of gender in shaping scientific knowledge. Science is both a profession and a body of knowledge, and Londa Schiebinger looks at how women have fared and performed in both instances. She first considers the lives of women scientists, past and present: How many are there? What sciences do they choose--or have chosen for them? Is the professional culture of science gendered? And is there something uniquely feminine about the science women do? Schiebinger debunks the myth that women scientists--because they are women--are somehow more holistic and integrative and create more cooperative scientific communities. At the same time, she details the considerable practical difficulties that beset women in science, where domestic partnerships, children, and other demanding concerns can put women's (and increasingly men's) careers at risk.</p><p>But what about the content of science, the heart of Schiebinger's subject? Have feminist perspectives brought any positive changes to scientific knowledge? Schiebinger provides a subtle and nuanced gender analysis of the physical sciences, medicine, archaeology, evolutionary biology, primatology, and developmental biology. She also shows that feminist scientists have developed new theories, asked new questions, and opened new fields in many of these areas.</p></p><p>Titles that pose rhetorical questions are generally attached to books that answer them affirmatively; <i>Has Feminism Changed Science?</i> is no exception. In the professional culture of science, Londa Schiebinger argues, the feminist perspective has profoundly affected both the types of questions being asked and the substance of new theories proposed as answers. Schiebinger, who has explored this territory in previous books (including <i>Nature's Body</i>), focuses on deconstructing the types of science women have been drawn to for careers and the obstacles they've faced inside and outside the laboratory. Balancing the roles of wife, mother, or domestic partner with the demands of a rigorous professional discipline can be career threatening; finding acceptance within the traditionally male culture of science <i>and</i> changing it to reflect new paradigms challenges even the most gifted researchers and teachers. Schiebinger breathes new life into a much-discussed subject, buttressing her arguments with a wealth of statistical analysis that makes her conclusions difficult to refute. Ultimately, she writes, the role of gender in scientific thinking has been forever altered by feminism, just as the role of women in the sciences has. From fetal development and drug testing to the way that archeologists look at primitive tools, the elimination of masculine bias has profoundly reshaped just how science views the world. <i>--Patrizia DiLucchio</i>Londa Schiebinger is John L.

Although there are several titles on polar bears available, such as Emilie Lepthien's Polar Bears (Children's, 1991), the popularity of these elegant endangered predators means there is usually room on the shelf for another attractive book. As for sandhills, these soign? cranes have been extremely neglected in favor of their larger, heavily endangered cousins, the whooping cranes. While there has been a spurt of books on the tarantula lately, including Susan Clymer's There's a Tarantula (Scholastic, 1997), the high "ick-factor" of these hairy arachnids creates a heavy demand for titles, and a previous dearth of material makes a new book helpful indeed.

This is a fascinating book, but it does not go quite far enough for my taste. There are not enough projects. However, armed with the knowledge in this book, you should be able to strike out on your own. Good photography, very clear instructions, history, exciting look at an artist in his workshop but only 5 projects. * Karen Platt * Aug 10 Watch a modern mosaic master in his studio and learn some of the tricks of the trade. This book is well illustrated with lots of shots of Marzi at work and it is certainly motivating to see what a truly renowned mosaicist&#39;s workplace looks like, and how he goes about his work. I&#39;ve got quite a few books on making mosaics and invariably they show somebody having a go in an ordinary home environment, often making something fairly basic. The projects in here are just as step-by-step, but seeing such a very different workplace and contrasting it with one&#39;s own kitchen table/garden shed etc can be rather intimidating. Reading between all this reveals several projects demonstrating the main types of mosaic: direct method, mesh method and reverse mosaic. A large amount of space is devoted to one project to make a brightly colored free standing bird sculpture for the garden, but you can also learn how to make a frieze, how the ancients worked and make a wall lamp. Discover a brief history of mosaic, how to cut the tiles, see the different materials used for making mosaics and find out at least some of what you need to buy. I would have preferred Search Press&#39; usual illustrated list of items all carefully laid out on a table but much of the information you need is in here somewhere. Somebody very used to a large number of craft processes or anybody who has done a small amount of mosaic work and has the tools and a little (but not much) experience ought to find it useful. * Myshelf.com *</p><h2>The rise of the English shipping industry in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries</h2><p>Physical description; xi,427,[8]p : ill, facsims, 1map, 1port ; 23cm.

King Louis XIV had the biggest palace in the world, the biggest army, and the biggest parties, and he gave the biggest gifts. Unfortunately for someone who cared about size, "King Louie (which is how you say &#x2018;Louis' in French) was a shrimp." So, in Steinberg's humorous account, he compensates. His Royal Carpenter builds him a big throne. The Royal Hairdresser makes him the biggest wig ever. The Royal Shoemaker fashions ridiculously big heels for his shoes. And each effort at making the king larger goes hilariously awry. Predictably, the message of the story is that Louie's size did not matter; the people liked him anyway because he had created a "proud and mighty nation," where they were happy and safe. With no sense of real history, this silly, enjoyable story is enlivened with Neubecker's bright palette and lively caricatures, the highlight being the full-bleed illustration of Louie's wig, too big for the page to contain, later seen drooping in the rain. The endpapers, showing Louie's colorful and high-heeled shoes, are a fitting visual footnote. Young readers will understand Louie's desire to be bigger, to impress people with his importance....Young readers will kick up their heels at such frivolity. (biographical facts) (Picture book/biography. 3-8) (Kirkus Reviews <i>5/1/17</i>)<br><br>Louis XIV of France was undeniably an important man, a great man, but according to this picture-book account, he was chagrined that he wasn&#x2019;t a <i>big </i>man. He had a huge, high throne constructed in search of height, but when he returned to the floor he was still the same size. Tall wigs were also a temporary fix. Elevated shoes looked like a good bet, but when the dance-loving monarch fell off his heels at a ball, he worried that his courtiers would ridicule him. &#x201c;But the people did not laugh. They knew that because of the king, France was a proud and mighty nation,&#x201d; and Louis happily danced the night away in his stockinged feet....this is a sprightly <i>gigue, </i>enhanced by Neubecker&#x2019;s humorous, hyperbolized artwork, and little kids will readily discern that, if you can&#x2019;t control your physical stature, you can certainly advance your social stature. (BCCB <i>June 2017</i>)<br><br>Louis XIV is the subject of this high-spirited picture book about the extremely vain French ruler&#x2019;s endeavor to become as great in stature as he was in accomplishments. After trying big hair and a big throne, Louie has the royal shoemaker construct shoes with high heels, unintentionally starting a new fashion trend for men and women alike. Everything works out in the end for the diminutive monarch when he realizes that people still love and respect him, despite his size. The feel-good story told in a conversational tone is accompanied by 14 amusing and informative facts about Louie, altogether painting a rosy picture of the king who &#x201c;waged war to keep the borders safe.&#x201d; Neubecker&#x2019;s cartoon illustrations are bright and full of whimsy. The details of baroque architecture and clothing are depicted in an accessible manner, and the characters are humorous and expressive, especially the baby-faced Louie. In playing with perspective, �Neubecker demonstrates how it feels to be a small king with huge aspirations. �VERDICT An amusing look at history; ideal for fans of Mac Barnett&#x2019;s President Taft Is Stuck in the Bath and other titles that show the human side of world leaders. An effective read-aloud or read-alone choice. (School Library Journal <i>June 1, 2017</i>)<br><br>Louis XIV of France commands the largest army in Europe, lives in the biggest palace, and gives the biggest parties. But there&#x2019;s a hiccup, and Steinberg (First Grade, Here I Come!) doesn&#x2019;t mince words: &#x201c;King Louie (which is how you say &#x2018;Louis&#x2019; in French) was a shrimp.&#x201d; Neubecker (Keith Haring: The Boy Who Just Kept Drawing), clearly having fun drawing his characters&#x2019; Baroque get-ups, portrays the monarch at a humbling height disadvantage compared to the rest of his court, which should win the Sun King instant sympathy with the book&#x2019;s target audience. With every resource at his disposal, the king tries to add inches by constructing skyscraper thrones, donning gigantic wigs, and wearing towering platform shoes that launch a fashion craze, but he learns the hard way that it&#x2019;s better to be respected as a sovereign than to intimidate by way of stature. Readers will pick up some valuable lessons, too: history is fun, size doesn&#x2019;t matter, and grownups do the darnedest things. A closing list of facts (14, naturally) adds a bit of historical heft. (Publishers Weekly <i>May 22, 2017</i>)<br><br>Roll out the red carpet for author D.J. Steinberg (Grasshopper Pie and Other Poems) and illustrator Robert Neubecker (Linus the Vegetarian T. rex), whose imperial collaboration tells the delightfully informative and visually stunning story of King Louis XIV's shoe folly.<br> <br> &nbsp;<br> <br> This nonfiction picture book introduces young readers to the king who was big in every way except height. He gave big parties, grew a big army and gave big gifts. But as Steinberg succinctly explains, "King Louie (which is how you say 'Louis' in French) was a shrimp." After failing several attempts to appear taller--a high throne, a full wig--he calls on his royal cobbler to craft a pair of high-heeled shoes.<br> <br> &nbsp;<br> <br> Louie's shoes are a hit, igniting a fashion trend. But when Louie's preposterous heels make him take a tumble on the dance floor, he realizes height is not the quality that makes a king great. "Off came the shoes./ Up came the king... dancing holes in his stocking feet!"<br> <br> &nbsp;<br> <br> Using different font colors and sizes, Steinberg's clever words draw as much attention as Neubecker's vibrantly alluring illustrations. Caricature drawings of the exaggerated wig and heels, a revealing carpenter and Louie's tantrum add lighthearted humor to this true tale. Meanwhile, the fashion of the period is creatively communicated through the women's hooped skirts, men's breeches and plenty of rich color.

Over the years, this didn&#x2019;t change much. Henry was considered a demi-god by his subjects, so each woman he chose was someone who had managed to stand out in a crowd of stunning ladies. Looking good was not enough (indeed, many of Henry&#x2019;s lovers were considered unattractive); she had to have something extra special to keep the King&#x2019;s interest. And Henry&#x2019;s women were every bit as intriguing as the man himself. In this book Henry&#x2019;s mistresses are rescued from obscurity. The 16th century was a time of profound changes in religion and society across Europe and some of Henry&#x2019;s lovers were at the forefront of influencing these events. </p></p><p>Kelly Hart is an English and history teacher."Provides an excellent insight into the love life of one of our most popular kings, and the 12 women who knew the man behind the mask."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Majesty </i>magazine</p><h2>My Big Picture Thesaurus [Jan 23, 2017] Hore, Rosie and Saunders, Rachael</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>The Power of a Half Hour: Take Back Your Life Thirty Minutes at a Time</h2><p><b>Turn your fleeting minutes into defining moments. </b><br> &nbsp;<br> What can you do in 30 minutes?

I could fill up this book and more with all kinds of spiritual and practical ideas about what works in life and what doesn&#x2019;t. I think it would be good stuff, but I have one practical idea that I know from my own experience rises far above all the others.<br><br>I admit it&#x2019;s not an overly unique concept, like the invention of the Internet, for example. However, it&#x2019;s an idea that has helped me realize success and great satisfaction in all aspects of my personal and professional life. I mean everything&#x2014;from personal goals and dreams to marriage to raising a family to relationships to work.<br><br>I believe the idea can change your life, though, as it has changed mine.<br><br>Most importantly, it has helped me serve God and others more effectively. Trust me, my idea is not rocket science; in fact, it&#x2019;s so simple that anyone can understand and benefit from it.<br><br>I believe the idea can change your life, though, as it has changed mine. I call it the power of a half hour.<br><br>Many people think of a half hour as a minimal or meaningless gap in time, downtime to catch your breath between periods of major effort. But the truth is your half hours can determine the difference between success and failure. Your half hours direct and shape your future.<br><br>You can literally change your world in thirty minutes. In the same way that your effect on the world is felt one life at a time, so is that effect delivered through the careful and thoughtful investment of your half hours. The beauty of this reality is that anyone can do it. You don&#x2019;t need a PhD, and you don&#x2019;t need a life coach to pull it off. All you need is to accept the idea, have a clear sense of your God-given purpose, examine your activity patterns, sensitize yourself to your time choices, and start taking advantage of the power of a half hour.<br><br>Every half hour in your day is a power-loaded resource. Your choice of how to spend those minutes is the focus of this book, which I intend to make a practical conversation about a resource that we misunderstand, abuse, take for granted, and ignore.<br><br>I want to help you become the person God intends you to be and accomplish His plans for your life. And in order to do that, you need to use your small increments of time wisely&#x2014;not just the big slices of time that are devoted to both routine daily activities and major life events.<br><br>I agree with Harvey Mackay who said, &#x201c;Time is free, but it&#x2019;s priceless. You can&#x2019;t own it, but you can use it. You can&#x2019;t keep it, but you can spend it. Once you&#x2019;ve lost it, you can never get it back.&#x201d;<br><br>I know that it&#x2019;s not easy to find even a &#x201c;free&#x201d; hour in the world we live in. I also have learned that it&#x2019;s difficult to accomplish a great deal in a quarter hour&#x2014;especially if you need to communicate graciously and genuinely with another person within that time frame. But a half hour&#x2014;it works!<br><br>Claiming the Power of a Half Hour<br><br>Here&#x2019;s how we will approach turning your half hours into life-changing blocks of time. In the seven parts of this book, I will outline how seizing the power of a half hour can make such a difference in these major areas:<br>� Impact<br>� Purpose and goals<br>� Faith<br>� Character<br>� Dreams<br>� Relationships<br>� Advancing God&#x2019;s kingdom<br><br>To help you remember key themes in this book, each chapter contains a Half-Hour Power Principle.<br><br>By the way, researchers tell us that most people never finish reading the books they start. Because I think there&#x2019;s too much helpful information in these pages for you to abandon the content before you get to the end, let me suggest that you do four simple but practical things as you read this book.<br><br>First, read the book in half-hour spaces in your schedule. Each of the chapters in the book is short enough to read easily in a half hour. You might want to have more than one block during a day when you read the book, but start this practice as you engage with this book. In addition, at the back of this book you will find a Personal Power of a Half Hour Action Plan. This plan is set up to help you, over a thirty-day period, fully incorporate The Power of a Half Hour<br>concepts into all major areas of your life. You have heard that it takes about a month to establish a new habit? I urge you to use this thirty-day plan to make the power of a half hour a habit you will never break!<br><br>Second, if something strikes you as personally helpful, jot down notes about changes you need to make. Too often we are so intent on getting through a book that we forget some of the useful insights or challenges it provided.<br><br>Third, pray that God will help you to implement the things you discover in these pages (or in your related reflections) that will improve your life experience. Fourth, and finally, express a commitment to someone you know and trust that you are going to integrate these simple changes into your lifestyle. Ask that person to check up on you once or twice a month to see how intentional you are being with your half hours. That simple act of accountability will help prevent the reading of this book from being just another helpful but forgotten task. (You may also wish to find mutual encouragement in learning the half-hour concepts by attending a small-group discussion. A guide for such a study is included at the end of the book.)<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been practicing these principles so long that I can now say I am a product of my half hours. I don&#x2019;t always get it right, but I&#x2019;m very much aware of the gift of life and the value of time. My half hours&#x2014;the ones I carefully plan, as&nbsp;well as the unplanned ones I discover&#x2014;are committed to doing His will in my life because I want to serve our God and others.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been practicing these principles so long that I can now say I am a product of my half hours.<br><br>If you get your half hours right, God will not only change your life but also use you to alter the lives of the people and organizations you influence. I sincerely believe the future is not going to be defined by those who rely on their intelligence, their talent, or their good looks. Instead, the future is dependent on the choices made by God&#x2019;s people in the time that He has placed at our disposal.</p><h2>The Greeks Overseas: The Early Colonies and Trade</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;A masterly summary.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></strong></p> The spread of Greek civilization through Europe and into Africa and the Near East began long before the classical period, long after Troy, Mycenae, and Knossos had fallen.

On the contrary, it is our actions that guide our emotions (laugh and you will feel happy). This led James to a remarkable conclusion: &#x201c;If you want a quality, act as if you already have it.&#x201d; Roused by James&#x2019;s astonishing discovery, renowned psychologist and bestselling author Richard Wiseman confirms James&#x2019;s principle and shows how the self-help genre has for too long put the cart before the horse in trying to help us take control of our lives. Bringing to the table a dazzling array of firsthand experiments, surprising histories, and psychological case studies, Wiseman illustrates in brilliant detail how we can apply this principle in our daily lives: <br><br><b>&#x2014;Smile to become measurably happier</b> <br><br><b>&#x2014;Wash your hands to drive away guilt</b> <br><br><b>&#x2014;Clench your fist to increase your willpower</b> <br><br><b>&#x2014;Eat with your non-dominant hand to lose weight</b> <br><br><b>&#x2014;Nod while speaking to become more persuasive</b> <br><br><b>&#x2014;Act like a newlywed to rekindle your marriage</b> <br><br>Lively, engaging, and truly mind-changing, <i>The As If Principle </i>is that rare gem that offers real, workable solutions for your day-to-day goals while helping you to instantly take control of your emotions.

Quite unexpectedly, this brought weeping, along with grief. After &#x201c;really hearing the rain,&#x201d; Dufrechou left his city life and immersed himself in the natural world, moving with his young family to the Rocky Mountains of Montana. Wanting to understand his own experience more fully, the author gathered stories from over forty people who, like him, found themselves feeling profoundly moved in response to nature. Moving through Grief, Reconnecting with Nature shares a mosaic experience of longing for nature that is deeply personal and yet universal, it describes a return to nature that is also a return to our sensations and emotions &#x2013; an opening of the heart. Joyful and sacred tears are portrayed alongside tears of loss and longing. Stories of the healing power of nature are shared from people who found nature their only solace during periods of bereavement. Indeed many of the experiences described in the book might be considered spiritual or mystical. A complex, nuanced, and powerful understanding of humanity&#x2019;s deep psychological connection with nature emerges, raising the possibility that a psychological return to nature might help humanity face the pressing global challenges threatening the survival of many species on our planet, including our own.</p><p><p>Jay Dufrechou, JD, PhD, worked for many years as an attorney before he followed the call of spiritual awakening into the experiential doctoral program at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology (ITP), now Sofia University, where he currently teaches transpersonal research ethics and dissertation research. In transition from the mountains of Montana to New York City, Dufrechou works primarily as a mediator and consultant in conflict resolution. He is active in the international Holotropic Breathwork community emerging from the work of Stanislav and Christina Grof.

In <i>Family Secrets</i>, she turns her attention to the deconstruction of pictures closer to home&#x2014;photographs from her own childhood and images from her shared ethnographic past&#x2014;to trace a trajectory from personal to collective acts of memory.</p><p><b>Annette Kuhn</b>&#x2019;s books include <i>Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema; Cinema, Censorship and Sexuality; The Power of the Image: Essays on Representation and Sexuality</i>; and <i>Women&#x2019;s Pictures: Feminism and Cinema</i>.

Lane Smith, conceptual artist for the film, has given James and company a new and arresting look, much in the style of his many highly regarded books, such as Math Curse and The Stinky Cheeseman. Karey Kirkpatrick, the film's screenwriter, created a text that is true to the spirit of Dahl's original, and deftly pulls young readers into the remarkable story.

Doctor Mitsuo Andoh discovers an encoded message during the autopsy of his old college friend, a philosophy professor who recently died under mysterious circumstances. The doctor must decipher the code if he hopes to understand a strange virus that kills people after watching a videotape. He finds that there were other, similar deaths the same night, at approximately the same time. Each autopsy reveals that the cause of death was sudden heart failure. The victims were all young and healthy. What's more, everyone who died had watched a tape containing a message that those who watch the video will die in a week. During the course of his research, Andoh traces the video to a smallpox patient and her daughter, Sadako, both of whom died horribly after the mother was raped. The story is intense and scary. Mizuki's masterfully smooth, black-and-white art translates the emotional expressions and tense moments without falling into the trap of in-your-face horror.<i>&#x2013;Erin Dennington, Fairfax County Public Library, Chantilly, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dumb. Dumb.<br><br>Anger beat a familiar cadence in Sandy Caine's head.<br><br>Sprinting off the training ground, he headed into the dry riverbed that ran alongside police headquarters. Some moat. You could drive a herd of goats across it. Or a truck filled with plastique.<br><br>Dumb, dumb, dumb . . .<br><br>Running harder now, the heels of his worn-out soccer shoes kicking up little puffs of dust in the wadi.<br><br>What was it that made General Rushman such a jerk? If they gave out oak leaf clusters for stupidity, the guy's ribbons would be sagging down there right next to his double-digit IQ.<br><br>It was only 0800 hours, but already the August sun hanging in the cloudless blue sky over Mogadishu was bringing the city to its morning boil. With each stride he felt the hot desert air tearing at his lungs.<br><br>Dumb, dumb . . .<br><br>Chest pounding, sweat coursing down his back, he no longer felt much like a Special Forces officer. He damn sure knew he didn't look like one. For the day's mission he was wearing a pair of chinos cut off at the knees and a faded blue soccer jersey in the colors of the Honduran World Cup team. As he scrambled up the far bank of the wadi, he could smell the pepper gas oozing from the jersey. It clung to his short, dirty-blond hair like bad perfume.<br><br>Dumb . . .<br><br>And suddenly it came to him.<br><br>General genes.<br><br>That had to be it. Evolution rolled the dice and out came these corporate types who could care less if they got you killed.<br><br>Until the summons from Rushman, the morning's mission had been relatively simple. All he had to do was convince Major Mustafa Kalil that even in times of national crisis it wasn't necessary to grease every enemy of state in sight. Not always. Sometimes you could tear gas them.<br><br>The major and the green recruits for the new Somali National Police were just starting to get it when Sandy heard Sergeant Santana's voice come crackling over the walkie-talkie.<br><br>"Hawk 6, this is East LA. You need to get back here. Over."<br><br>Sandy punched the button and identified himself. "Come on, Sarge. Give me a break."<br><br>"I'd move it, sir. Excelsior is pissing in his boot."<br><br>Excelsior was the radio handle of Colonel Willard Jenkins, General Rushman's executive officer and brown-nose-in-chief. Which figured. Cursing softly, Sandy punted his gas mask ten yards down the training field.<br><br>SOS--Same Old Shit. One minute you were doing your job, the next you had your heels locked in the commanding general's headquarters, taking crap from a perfumed prince who could ruin your life if he didn't like your attitude.<br><br>Damn right, he had an attitude.<br><br>That's what it all came down to, he reflected, slowing to a trot. Attitude protected his mind the way a sheath protects a fine knife. It was essential to his survival, like wound dressings in a medic's kit. He was pushing thirty. A brooder. On the days when he thought he should bag the Army, it occurred to him that he knew a dozen ways to kill a man for every way of being one.<br><br>He was a captain with a golden name and a platinum future. Five years out of West Point and he spent half his time wondering why he didn't quit and get a life. He came from a tradition--eight generations of Caine warriors, six from the Point. But he was no traditionalist. He broke things, rules, icons, not just gas masks. Before the voice of authority, what he felt was a trickle of contempt, not the terror that made lifers grovel.<br><br>For a moment he stood there, waiting for the anger to cool. On the far side of the wadi, he saw Summar the mop man coming out of the command post. Summar was wearing the same faded cotton shirt and torn trousers he put on every day. Most of the time he went around barefoot. This morning he had on a new pair of Air Jordans.<br><br>The sun and wind had mummified his face. When he saw Sandy, he gathered his skinny body into a travesty of attention and saluted. Nice old guy. Mopped the floors every morning with muddy water from an old bucket, swirling fresh arabesques of filth over the patterns he had laid down the day before. After work he went over to the Bakar Market and reported the day's intelligence from police headquarters to the Somali National Liberation Front. The Nikes had to come from somewhere.<br><br>Summar's treachery was transparent, perhaps even useful. Sandy used him to spread disinformation. From across the wadi, he returned the mop man's salute. Soaked in sweat, he double-timed it to the rear of the four-story building that housed his command post. The rest of the Bakar Market district consisted of colonial villas faded to soft brown, mud houses with earthen roofs, and thousands of wooden shanties. Towering above them, the walls of police headquarters reminded him of a castle looking over a medieval slum.<br><br>The concrete walls were scarred from old battles. On the second floor, the dark smudge left by an exploding RPG round looked like the bruise circling a black eye. Sandy pushed open a steel door and went down a splintered flight of stairs to the cellar. When he came into the command bunker, he found Santana bent over a Sabre MX. The radio was lying on a crate covered by a frayed prayer rug. Talking quickly and softly into the hand mike, the A-Team's commo expert sounded like a man trying to calm a barking terrier.<br><br>"Yes, sir. I know, sir. Hawk 6 knows you're looking for him. He's on the way, sir."<br><br>Santana was a tall Latino from East Los Angeles. Cool, a little eccentric, even for Special Forces--sometimes the meditation and tai chi got to be too much for the other men. They read war stories and thrillers. Santana read American Anthropologist. In his footlocker, he kept a travel-tattered copy of his master's thesis--"The Guayaquil Tribe and the Shining Path"--along with the wooden flute the tribe's ghost talker had given him at the end of his field work. He spoke Japanese and Italian as well as Spanish and English. The CIA was always trying to steal him. For his mind, and for his other assets. He could do twenty-five one-armed push-ups and kill silently with either hand.<br>Right now, he was just trying to buy Sandy some time.<br><br>"Yes, Colonel. He knows who's looking for him. Sergeant Caldwell went over to the training field himself to get him."<br><br>Panting as if he'd just run the Boston Marathon, Sandy leaned against the wall of the bunker and let Santana play the spluttering colonel. On the wall behind the radio, two lizards were hunting flies. Sandy watched them until his breathing returned to normal. When Santana gave him the hand mike, he hefted it gingerly, as if it were a live grenade. Then he pressed the push-to-talk button.<br><br>"This is Hawk 6," he said. "Is Thundering Eagle having a nice day?"<br><br>Colonel Jenkins registered the jab at Rushman's handle but saved it for later. "Cut the crap, Captain. Where the hell have you been?"<br><br>"Across the wadi, sir. Training. East LA told me you called."<br><br>"You're damn right I did. Twenty minutes ago."<br><br>Over the hand mike, Jenkins sounded like an air horn in an end zone--pompous and a long way from any danger on the field. Sandy drummed the top of the Sabre. Gray dust covered his slender fingers. "I'm here now, sir. What's this all about?"<br><br>"What it's about, Captain, is Abu Bakar." Jenkins paused for effect. "We've got twenty-four dead Pakis and four Americans KIA over the last ten days. You are aware of that, I assume, Captain Caine?"<br><br>"That I am, sir."<br><br>"Well, the little bastard's right out there laughing at us. Thundering Eagle wants to talk to you. And the word he used was now. I suggest you get here ten minutes ago." He clicked off.<br><br>Sandy passed the dead handset back to Santana and sat down. Absently, he ran two fingers over his chin. A three-day beard stubbled his jaw, a pale blond mustache was advancing above his lip. Stubble chic wasn't Thundering Eagle's thing.<br><br>Screw Thundering Eagle.<br><br>Sandy's eyes moved to the short stack of mail sitting on the crate next to the radio: a letter from Lieutenant Atkinson's wife--you could tell by the green ink--and a purple envelope from Sergeant Mayemura's girlfriend. The two soldiers competed over the number of letters they got from home. After four months, Atkinson was ahead by two letters, but the purple tide from Waikiki was still running strong.<br><br>Sandy also saw the May issue of Bon App�tit magazine. Three months late, but that never bothered its most loyal reader. Eddie Mayemura, master of good chow and bad vibrations. Blow up that bridge, Eddie, but don't let that souffl� fall. Mayemura could do it all.<br>At the bottom of the stack, Sandy found a note from Melba, the envelope square, feminine, the address in bold script. Shoving it into his pocket, he tossed the rest of the letters to Santana. "Mail call, Professor. Better get these out."<br><br>He stood up and stretched. Santana was already halfway out the bunker. "Ask Sergeant Caldwell to meet me out front in five minutes," Sandy called after him. "And tell him to fire up the Blue Deuce."<br><br>Up one floor in the squad room, Master Sergeant Nathan Preston Caldwell, the A-Team's senior NCO, was taking Friday off. Caldwell had it all worked out. The Muslims got Fridays for prayers, and that meant the A-Team had to work Sundays. So it was only right for him to take Friday off, too. But not for praying. When Santana found him, he was pressing the only cold beer in downtown Mogadishu to his cheek.<br>No one ever wrote Sergeant Caldwell letters. The married NCOs on the A-Team carried pictures of their wives and kids in their wallets. In the cobra-skin billfold Caldwell had taken off a dead Cuban in Angola, he kept pictures of his favorite guns.<br><br>At forty-four, Nate Caldwell left the impression on weaker men that he could crush them with one hand.

Loehr&#39;s 30-day program shows readers how to gradually make the kind of personal lifestyle changes that bring about the kind of high-level performance demanded of people at every level of the corporation.</p><p><i>Stress for Success: Jim Loehr's Program for Transforming Stress into Positive Energy at Work,</i> by James E. Loehr, expands upon the author's 20 years of experience in preparing high-level executives and world-class athletes for the "stress of competition." It is built upon his contrarian contention that stress does not necessarily inhibit productivity and effectiveness; in fact, he argues, it can actually prove to be a "powerful stimulus" for personal and professional growth. The secret, he says, is learning how to respond, and he presents a 30-day program (similar to an elite athlete's training regimen) intended to do just that.James E.

In this latest book, Mr. Espy has created a preposterous wonderland, a garden such as never was. Besides its flowers, Espy&#39;s Garden is inhabited by creatures large and small, lovable and quarrelsome, beautiful and ugly, each incarnating some figure of speech (or trope) - that magical device that extends the range of language to infinity. Metaphor, hyperbole, alliteration, pleonasmus, litotes, tmesis - these are but a sprinkling of the unforgettable Garden folk. Espy explains more than 200 rhetorical devices, dozens of them in verses sung by the tropes themselves. Each verse is followed by a definition, a comment, and examples of the usage in history, literature, and everyday speech. Thirty of the figures come visually alive in Teresa Allen&#39;s charming and witty illustrations, and word games abound throughout the book.</p><p></p><h2>The Wheel of Life: Bunny Allen, A Life of Safaris and Romance</h2><p>Bunny Allen arrived in Kenya in 1927 with a disire to become a professional white hunter&#x2015;what he became was a legend.

After raising six children of her own, in addition to being a stepmother to four and a grandmother, multitasking is Kris&#x2019;s way of life. But she would have never made it without her unwavering belief in God. <br><br>In this thoughtful, candid, and no-nonsense memoir, Kris Jenner is an open book about the good times and the rough patches.

For 10,000 years the desert had been mined for silver, iron, and copper, but it was the 19th-century discovery of nitrate that transformed the country into a modern state and forced the desert's colonization.<br><br>The mines' riches generated mansions and oligarchs in Chile's more temperate region&#x2014;and terrible inequalities throughout the country. The Norte Grande also gave birth to the first Chilean democratic and socialist movements, nurturing every major political figure of modern Chile from Salvador Allende to Augusto Pinochet. In this richly layered personal memoir, illustrated with the author's own photographs, Dorfman sets out to explore the origins of contemporary Chile&#x2014;and, along the way, seek out his wife's European ancestors who came years ago to Chile as part of the nitrate rush. And, most poignantly, he looks for traces of his friend and fellow 1960s activist, Freddy Taberna, executed by a firing squad in a remote Pinochet death camp.</p><p>Ariel Dorfman, the Chilean novelist, playwright, journalist, poet, and human rights activist was forced into exile form his homeland following the Chilean military coup of 1973. Since the restoration of democracy in 1990, he has divided his time between Santiago and the United States. Among his many works are the memoir <i>Heading South, Looking North</i>&nbsp;and the highly acclaimed play <i>Death and the Maiden. </i>His writings have won numerous awards, including the Sir Laurence Olivier Award for best play in London, 1992. He contributes regularly to major newspapers and magazines around the world. He is a distinguished professor at Duke University and lives with his wife Ang�lica, in Durham, North Carolina, and Santiago, Chile.Prolific Chilean writer Dorfman and his wife, Ang&#x201a;lica, travel north from Santiago, Chile, through the world's driest desert, the Atacama, an area where two millimeters of rain can cause a deadly mudslide. In recounting his journey "to the origins," Dorfman brings elements from his broad range as a writer. Dorfman the journalist weaves encyclopedic information into his text (e.g., facts on Monte Verde, possibly "the oldest settlement ever discovered in the Americas"), while Dorfman the poet gives color to the desert ("a dizzying array of browns and grays and terra-cottas") and vitality to places like Pampa Union, once "a town of brothels and bars, opium dens and gambling joints, a town only visited now by the whirlwinds and the shifting sands." As Ang&#x201a;lica searches for truths about her family history, Dorfman the novelist unravels the labyrinthine tale along with her. The playwright, a keen listener, lets diverse others tell much of the tale, including a "gathering of elderly pampinos," novelist Hern&nbsp;n Rivera Letelier and archeologist Lautaro N��ez. Throughout the three-week trip, Dorfman the human rights activist foregrounds the figure of the desaparecido as he searches for "the disappeared body" of his friend Freddy Taberna. Archeology and astronomy, history and legend, intimate detail and public policy, relics from 50,000 years ago and mass graves from three decades ago are joined in this compelling trek. Readers whose baggage includes, as Dorfman's did at the beginning, "a deep-seated prejudice against deserts in general" will change their tune as they travel through this book, which entertains, informs and deeply engages.

Sodom and Gomorrah is also an unforgiving analysis of both the decadent high society of Paris and the rise of a philistine bourgeoisie that will inevitably supplant it. Proust was born in Auteuil (the southern sector of Paris's then-rustic 16th arrondissement) at the home of his great-uncle, two months after the Treaty of Frankfurt formally ended the Franco-Prussian War. His birth took place during the violence that surrounded the suppression of the Paris Commune, and his childhood corresponds with the consolidation of the French Third Republic. Much of Remembrance of Things Past concerns the vast changes, most particularly the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of the middle classes, that occurred in France during the Third Republic and the fin de si�cle. Proust's father, Achille Adrien Proust, was a famous doctor and epidemiologist, responsible for studying and attempting to remedy the causes and movements of cholera through Europe and Asia; he was the author of many articles and books on medicine and hygiene. Proust's mother, Jeanne Cl�mence Weil, was the daughter of a rich and cultured Jewish family. Her father was a banker. She was highly literate and well-read. Her letters demonstrate a well-developed sense of humour, and her command of English was sufficient for her to provide the necessary impetus to her son's later attempts to translate John Ruskin.</p><p>Marcel Proust, born into a wealthy French family on July 10, 1871, started his writing career covering the exclusive Parisian drawing rooms. Proust was half-Jewish, which led him to support Alfred Dreyfus during the infamous anti-Semitic affair. Upon the death of his mother, Proust began a voluntary seclusion that led him to write the seven part work, In Search of Lost Time, or Remembrance of Things Past.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Utamaro: Colour Prints and Paintings</h2><p>Utamaro is one of the most significant figures in the history of Japanese art, and one who has had an incalculable influence on Western artists. Born in 1753, he lived all his life in Edo, a central figure in a culture that was of the people rather than the aristocracy, and whose typical forms of expression were the Kabuki plays, light novelettes, comic verse and colour-woodcuts. He spans a period during which each of these arts was brought to its point of ultimate achievement, a period, too, of a flux of ideas and the first stirrings of the social and political changes that were to ensue in the 19th century. <br><br>His work includes designs for some of the loveliest illustrated books in the world, and his broadsheets, at their best, are marked by powers of composition and imaginative design that single him out from all other artists of the color-print movement. Yet although in the West Utamaro is, next to Hokusai, the best-known and most admired of Japanese artists, Mr. Hililer's book - first published in 1961 and now reissued in a revised format - remains the fullest and most comprehensively illustrated monograph in a Western language since Kurth's of 1907. <br><br>Like other 'Floating World' artists, Utamaro drew his material primarily from the demi-monde of Edo. The courtesans, alone or with her elegant consorts, figures in countless prints, in broth or tea-house, in boating parties along the Sumida River, or among the flowering trees in the pleasure-gardens of Edo. The famous insect book, and the no less remarkable 'Bird' and 'Shell' books, prove his outstanding powers in an entirely different genre.</p><p></p><h2>The Black Belt Memory Jogger: A Pocket Guide for Six Sigma Success</h2><p><b>(Please note that this is the old edition of this book and that it has been replaced by <i>The Black Belt Memory Jogger Second Edition</i>, published in May 2016)</b> <p> Starting with a clear depiction of the DMAIC model and the roles and responsibilities that help ensure that Six Sigma methodologies become ingrained in the organization, The Black Belt Memory Jogger? clarifies concepts and tools, from Critical To flowdown through Control Plans, illuminating these methods in twenty-five detailed chapters of Six Sigma know-how.

A gift. &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b> <br><br> Following her bestselling <i>The Architect of Desire</i>, Suzannah Lessard returns with a remarkable book, a work of relentless curiosity and a graceful mixture of observation and philosophy. This intriguing hybrid will remind some of W. G. Sebald&#x2019;s work and others of Rebecca Solnit&#x2019;s, but it is Lessard&#x2019;s singular talent to combine this profound book-length mosaic&#x2015;a blend of historical travelogue, reportorial probing, philosophical meditation, and prose poem&#x2015;into a work of unique genius, as she describes and reimagines our landscapes. In this exploration of our surroundings, <i>The Absent Hand</i> contends that to reimagine landscape is a form of cultural reinvention. <br><br>This engrossing work of literary nonfiction is a deep dive into our surroundings&#x2015;cities, countryside, and sprawl&#x2015;exploring change in the meaning of place and reimagining the world in a time of transition. Whether it be climate change altering the meaning of nature, or digital communications altering the nature of work, the effects of global enclosure on the meaning of place are panoramic, infiltrative, inescapable. No one will finish this book, this journey, without having their ideas of living and settling in their surroundings profoundly enriched.</p><p><b>SUZANNAH LESSARD</b> is the bestselling author of <i>The Architect of Desire: Beauty and Danger in the Stanford White Family</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book.

A subjective, Whitmanesque meditation on the way we live today . . . What makes this book compelling is not so much where the author goes, but how she reflects on what she sees when she gets there . . . Her wonderfully trenchant observations cast new light on the everyday." &#x2015;Witold Rybczynski, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"In an elegant series of essays, <i>New Yorker</i> contributor Lessard (<i>The Architect of Desire</i>) explores the American landscape as a metaphor for recent shifts in the national consciousness . . . Throughout, Lessard offers an extraordinary way of examining and understanding the aesthetics of different environments, whether urban, suburban, or bucolic, which will inspire readers to look with new curiosity at the places around them." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) <br><br>"Suzannah Lessard has a truly penetrating intelligence, and here she turns it on a truly compelling target: the landscape that surrounds us, and which we too often see as background if we see it at all. Reading this book will, no kidding, let you look at the world in a new way, and that is a remarkable gift." &#x2015;Bill McKibben, author of <i>Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?</i> <br><br> "<i>The Absent Hand: Reimagining Our American Landscape</i> is a place-based book in the deepest sense. Lessard's keen observations about selected landscapes in which she has thoroughly immersed herself in order to parse their broader underlying meanings ranks her style with Thoreau's experiential mode of writing. The book is pitch-perfect and filled with cogent philosophical interpretations, a loving and shrewd appraisal of the physical fabric of our once- and still-beautiful but fraught country." &#x2015;Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, president of the Foundation for Landscape Studies<br><br>"<i>The Absent Hand</i> is like no other book I have read, narrated by a writer whose perceptions and language are as radically original as they are eloquent. Observed with a gentle irony, an abiding lyricism, and an acute sense of the comfortable pieties we live by, Suzannah Lessard's hybrid creation&#x2015;part memoir, part history, part literary criticism, and part sociological document&#x2015;is an elegy to the all-but-lost power of landscape. Whether commenting on an abandoned but still vibrant village in the Hudson River Valley, 'suburbaphobia' among the educated elite, the 'peculiar stillness' of Sheraton hotel rooms, or the complex artifice of the Disney vision, <i>The Absent Hand</i> explores the way we inhabit the space around us, physically as well as mentally, individually as well as collectively. It is a wise as well as poignant book, leavened by flashes of humor&#x2015;one that will make you think about the bargains we have made with our natural surroundings and the price we have paid for them." &#x2015;Daphne Merkin, author of <i>This Close to Happy</i> <br><br>"One of Suzannah Lessard's great gifts is that of seeing, of discerning and explaining the details most of us skip past. She is also gifted at conveying this precise view. Everyone who reads this book will see the American landscape differently, in its urban and rural variety and splendor and disrepair. Readers will also have a clearer appreciation for what is beautiful and why&#x2015;and of how the unlovely might be restored." &#x2015;James Fallows, coauthor of <i>Our Towns</i><br><br>"In a series of finely tuned essays that track the author's journey from the Hudson Valley into the Midwest and the South, Lessard explores the relationship between humanity and place that once defined us but, she argues, doesn't any longer." &#x2015;Jonathan Hahn, <i>Sierra</i> <br><br>"This book of thought-provoking essays queries the nature of place, asking landscapes to reveal their meanings . . .

In episodic chapters, Lessard probes a medley of places: the mountain villages of upstate New York; Brooklyn housing projects; the sprawl and megamall of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania; and plantations in Natchez, Mississippi . . . As Lessard alternates between narrative and analysis, what begins as a pastiche of vignettes builds into an entrancing reconsideration of America&#x2019;s history, from the spaces of the antebellum South through the landscapes of the Cold War and beyond . . . A stellar work of landscape criticism, a rapturous meditation on the revelatory power of place." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> <br><br> "The value of her decades of research is undeniable . . . In this ambitious work, place is examined, deconstructed and incrementally illuminated, even as our landscape changes anew. This broad social-historical consideration of American landscapes will satisfy and challenge the most serious reader." &#x2015;<i>Shelf Awareness</i> <br><br>"Part memoir, part examination of the American cultural landscape.

(Child&#39;s Play Library)</h2><p>It&#39;s Christmas and the little Mouse is looking forward to opening the presents around the tree. But what about the Big Hungry Bear who lives on top of the hill? The little Mouse&#39;s brave and generous spirit reminds us that Christmas is for everyone, not just ourselves. The little Mouse and the big, hungry Bear are known and loved by millions of children around the world. Published in 1984, The Little Mouse, The Red Ripe Strawberry, and the Big Hungry Bear has been a perennial bestseller for over twenty years in countries and languages too numerous to mention.</p><p>Husband and wife team Don and Audrey Wood follow up on their international bestseller <i>The Little Mouse, the Red Ripe Strawberry, and the Big Hungry Bear</i> with a yuletide message about giving.<p> The little Mouse has holed up in his cozy home for Christmas, under long, shiny garlands and a gigantic, glowing tree. And what a huge pile of gifts he's got! ("My goodness! What a lot of presents. Are they all for you?") But then he starts to worry about "the big, hungry Bear in the cold, dark cave at the top of the hill" and how he'd do anything to get a hold of Mouse's presents. ("Ohhh, how that Bear loves Christmas presents!") So it's out with the padlock, boards over the door, and tacks all over the floor. Good old Mouse, though, has a last- minute change of heart and realizes that maybe he should be sharing his presents--not locking them up--so he heads off to visit his ursine friend.</p><p> The appeal of this series may continue to be a mystery to some grownups, but the fun, repetitive text and playful acrylics will likely win over any kid--even if we never get to see that big, hungry Bear at all.

She has never known human companionship, exercise, or decent care. One night, rescuers arrive and take her and the other dogs away to lead new and happier lives. Soon, despite her fears, she finds herself in a warm, secure foster home, being bathed and groomed and loved by a young woman named Emma. At first, she is too frightened to respond; all she wants is to return to the familiar dark.</p><p>Eventually renamed Dakota, she learns to love and trust Emma, and her foster home becomes a friendly haven. But then a new challenge arrives in the person of a young girl, Sweetie, who is recovering from a misfortune as deep as Dakota&#x2019;s own. Sweetie and her parents come to look at Dakota as a possible pet. Initially, Sweetie rejects hairless little Dakota, but later she returns to offer Dakota a home, and Emma recommends her for adoption.

Dakota is almost hairless and has sore feet from standing on the wire flooring of her cage. A volunteer, Emma, fosters her and eventually finds her a loving home. Dakota's future owner, a girl who is sick and has lost her hair, at first rejects the pup because she considers her ugly, but she later bonds with the animal. This part of the story is not completely convincing. However, the illustrations of the dog enjoying her first bath and comfortable bed are wonderful. Lane also captures the pet's vulnerability as she learns to walk and to enjoy companionship. The atrocious conditions and tragic lives of these creatures are briefly and accurately described. This sensitive portrayal will educate young readers through its poignant story and the brief facts provided at the end about helping such dogs.&#x2014;<i>Carol Schene, formerly at Taunton Public Schools, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But not this book. Here, Billy's mom issues a few scary warnings about the woods to her son--"Beware! Beware! The Forest of Sin! None come out, but many go in!"--turns her back for a second, and the next thing you know the devil shows up and whispers something to Bobby about wild strawberries. Blammo! Guess where Billy goes--straight to the forbidden forest, of course. At this point, if you are reading the story aloud to your child, you may think there's a parable on the way. But just when you might expect to run into monsters named Lust, Avarice, and Three-Toed Sloth (okay, maybe not Lust), a real monster comes careening along and you realize that this story is just a fairy tale after all--and quite a lovely one at that.<p> <i>The Minpins</i> taps into the powerful, wonderful child's fantasy of discovering a hidden civilization of tiny folk that accepts and honors him or her. The very best part of this fairy tale is the denouement, where Billy receives the gift of nightly escape on the wings of a swan. One of Roald Dahl's only picture books--with fabulously crosshatched pen-and-ink illustrations by Patrick Benson--<i>The Minpins</i> is superb for reading aloud to the three- to eight-year-old set. And it culminates in a sentence or two of advice that your children just might remember for the rest of their lives. <i>(Ages 3 to 8)</i></p>Roald Dahl, the best-loved of children&#39;s writers, was born in Wales of Norwegian parents. After school in England he went to work for Shell in Africa. He began to write after &#34;a monumental bash on the head&#34;, sustained as an RAF pilot in World War II. Roald Dahl died in 1990.</p><h2>Growltiger&#39;s last stand, with, The Pekes and the Pollicles, and, The song of the Jellicles</h2><p>Three poems describe the nighttime adventures of some rather special cats.</p><p>Grade 6 Up Three poems from Eliot's rollicking ode to felines, Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats (HBJ, 1939), are gloriously and elegantly illustrated by Le Cain. ``Growltiger's Last Stand,'' ``Of the Awefull Battle of the Pekes and Pollicles,'' and ``The Song of the Jellicles'' spring to life with Le Cain's stylish paintings that match and extend each verse of the rich text. Sinister Siamese arranged in triangles represent Growltiger's foe ``armed with toasting forks and cruel carving knives''; chaos reigns as the Pugs and Poms ``Bark bark bark bark/ Bark bark BARK BARK/ Until you can hear them all over the Park''; suave black-and-white cats ``like to practice their airs and graces/ And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise.'' The clean typeface and layout make Eliot's poetry take center stage framed by the wonderful illustrations. The book is a worthy introduction to a major poet's work and should lead readers on to the complete volume. It will certainly create memories of its own.

The delicate watercolors depict a fully furnished beachhouse, a ``modest'' shingled cottage with pool and windowed porch, in a brochure style that is suffused with a gentle daylight. No people are shown so that readers may project themselves into the idyllic scenes. Only a stuffed bear and other toys add a coy hint of youthful human habitation. While the left-hand pages house the pictures, the right present the cumulative verses and tiny vignettes taken from the facing painting--a design trick that seems forced because the items selected don't add any special visual meanings. This walking tour is quite pleasant, if a bit dull, as readers are lead from the front door across the floor through all the rooms in this million-dollar house. Caldecott's tour of the house that Jack built is much more gritty fun. --Kenneth Marantz, Art Education Department, Ohio State University, Columbus<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Entity: Five Centuries of Secret Vatican Espionage</h2><p><p>The International Bestseller<br><br>&#x201c;A true story that surpasses any novel by John le Carr�.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>El Pa</i><i>�s </i>(Spain)<br><br>For five centuries, the Vatican&#x2014;the oldest organization in the world, maker of kings and shaper of history&#x2014;has used a secret spy service, called the Holy Alliance, or later, the Entity, to carry out its will.

Treasures of the Reformation: Catalogue</h2><p>In the framework of the Here I Stand project, exhibitions will be shown in Minneapolis, New York, and Atlanta in Fall 2016. Focusing on unique exhibits from authentic places of Luther&#39;s life and the history of the Reformation, these exhibitions present a comprehensive picture of the life and work of Martin Luther, his Reformation, its cultural-historical context and lasting impact. This catalogue brings together a thematically structured description of the various exhibits, most of which are being shown abroad for the first time. Original Luther objects and autographs as well as archaeological finds from the Luther sites in Eisleben, Mansfeld, and Wittenberg illuminate the personality of the Reformer and his environment. They are supplemented by a spectacular collection of artistic and graphic masterpieces, sculptures, objets d&#39;art and important printed works. Seen as a whole they offer a unique overview of the important cultural treasures of the birthplace of the Reformation.</p><p></p><h2>Spooner</h2><p>Warren Spooner was born after a prolonged delivery in a makeshift delivery room in a doctor&#39;s office in Milledgeville, Georgia, on the first Saturday of December, 1956. His father died shortly afterward, long before Spooner had even a memory of his face, and was replaced eventually by a once-brilliant young naval officer, Calmer Ottosson, recently court-martialed out of service. This is the story of the lifelong tie between the two men, poles apart, of Spooner&#39;s troubled childhood, troubled adolescence, violent and troubled adulthood and Calmer Ottosson&#39;s inexhaustible patience, undertaking a life-long struggle to salvage his step-son, a man he will never understand.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:</strong> Warren Spooner is a sad sack. His mother despises him as the surviving twin from a hideously painful delivery. He's not very smart, and his one redeeming talent--baseball--is nullified by catastrophic injury. He gets into trouble, a lot. Though he manages to organize his life through marriage and a (terrible) job, the self-destructive behavior endures. Fortunately, Pete Dexter--winner of the National Book Award for <em>Paris Trout</em>--provides a calming figure in his step-father, Calmer Ottosson, a man with his own life of promise and disappointment, as well as inexhaustible patience for his wayward ward. Plot's not Dexter's focus--the story ambles through a series of monstrous vignettes projected through unblinking eyes, to the point where the awfulness becomes hilarious and absurd (e.g. a burial at sea gone horribly wrong, complete with erotic misunderstandings). It's like reading Garrison Keillor through a glass of blood: relentlessly dark, yet ultimately affirming. <em>--Jon Foro</em><br>Pete Dexter began his working life with a U.S. Post office in New Orleans, Louisiana. He wasn't very good at mail and quit, then caught on as a newspaper reporter in Florida, which he was not very good at, got married, and was not very good at that. In Philadelphia he became a newspaper columnist, which he was pretty good at, and got divorced, which you would have to say he was good at because it only cost $300.<br><br>Dexter remarried, won the National Book Award and built a house in the desert so remote that there is no postal service. He's out there six months a year, pecking away at the typewriter, living proof of the adage <i>What goes around comes around</i>--that is, you quit the post office, pal, and the post office quits you.<br><br></p><h2>Power and Resistance: The Delhi Coronation Durbars</h2><p><table><tbody><tr><td>Power and Resistance is published in association with The Alkazi Foundation for the Arts<br><br>Features vital photographs that were commissioned from the foremost British and Indian <br>photographers such as Raja Deen Dayal &amp; Sons, Vernon &amp;Co., and Bourne &amp; Shepherd, as well as those shot by amateur photographers.<br><br>Focuses on photographs made for those who attended the Delhi Durbars and for a global audience who did not attend.<br><br>The essays focus on semiotics of image and the role of Durbar photographs in visually rendering the complexities of colonial logic.<br><br>The Durbars were occasions marking the formal coronations of English monarchs as empress and emperors of India: Victoria in 1877, Edward VII in 1903 and George V in 1911.

The internal differences between a heroine raised in the lap of luxury and a hero brought up in foster homes and trained on the battlefield are underscored by their physical differences--she's small and feminine, while he's rugged and fiercely masculine. Their characters, however, are equally stubborn and brave with hot tempers that are evenly matched. There's action aplenty in this adventurous story, with hot love scenes in the African brush, as well as in opulent bedrooms, and endearing secondary characters. <i>To Love A Man</i> firmly establishes Robards as an author who moves easily between subgenres. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i></p></p><h2>Shadows of Victory: Rhineland Inheritance/Gibraltar Passage/Sahara Crosswinds (Rendezvous with Destiny 1-3)</h2><p>A collection of the first three volumes of the best-selling series details post-Nazi Europe and the struggles of Captain Jake Burnes and French officer Pierre Servais and includes &#34;Rhineland Inheritance,&#34; &#34;Gibraltar Passage,&#34; and &#34;Sahara Crosswind.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Trees of Christmas</h2><p>Vintage book with defined stories of different cultures of Christmas trees around the world with brilliant albeit vintage photographs of the trees.</p><p></p><h2>The Case of the Disappearing Deejay (Nancy Drew No. 89)</h2><p>KRCK DJ Dan Wildman is apparently kidnapped while on the air, and Nancy must wade through a lot of fast talking to find the culprit and save rock and roll</p><p></p><h2>Evening Stars (Blackberry Island)</h2><p><strong><em>&#x201c;Mallery pulls out all the stops in this highly enjoyable and insightful, funny, and poignant look at self-sacrifice and romantic entanglement.&#x201d; </em></strong><strong>&#x2014;Booklist Starred Review<br><br>On #1 </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> bestselling author Susan Mallery&#x2019;s charming Blackberry Island, two sisters are on the verge of making their dreams reality </strong><br><br>Small-town nurse Nina Wentworth has made a career out of being a caretaker.

She pulled the short-sleeved scrub shirt over her head and was already moving toward the bathroom before the fabric settled over her hips.<br><br>"Don't be snug, don't be snug," she chanted as she came to a stop in front of the mirror and reached for her brush.<br><br>The shirt settled as it should, with a couple of inches to spare. Nina breathed a sigh of relief. Last night's incident with three brownies and a rather large glass of red wine hadn't made a lasting impression on her hips. She was grateful and she would repent later on an elliptical. Or at least vow to eat her brownies one at a time.<br><br>Ten seconds of brushing, one minute of braiding and her blond hair was neat and tidy. She dashed out into the hall, toward the kitchen where she grabbed her car keys and nearly made it to the back door. Just as she was reaching for the knob, the house phone rang.<br><br>Nina glanced from the clock to the phone. Everyone in her world-friends, family, work-had her cell. Very few calls came on the antiquated land line and none of them were good news. Nina retraced her steps and braced herself for disaster. "Hello?"<br><br>"Hey, Nina. It's Jerry down at Too Good To Be True. I just opened and there's a lady here trying to sell a box of crap, ah, stuff. I think it's from the store."<br><br>Nina closed her eyes as she held in a groan. "Let me guess. Early twenties, red hair with purple streaks and a tattoo of a weird bird on her neck?"<br><br>"That's her. She's glaring at me something fierce. You think she's armed?"<br><br>"I hope not."<br><br>"Me, too." Jerry didn't sound especially concerned. "What's her name?"<br><br>"Tanya."<br><br>If Nina had more time, she would have collapsed right there on the floor. But she had a real job to get to. A job unrelated to the disaster that was the family's antique store.<br><br>"You let your mom hire her, huh?" Jerry asked.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"You know better."<br><br>"That I do. I'll call the police and ask them to pick up Tanya. Can you keep her there until they get there?"<br><br>"Sure thing, kid."<br><br>"Great. And I'll be by after work to pick up the stuff."<br><br>"I'll hold it for you," Jerry promised.<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>Nina hung up and hurried to her car. After her cell connected to the Bluetooth, she called the local sheriff's department and explained what happened.<br><br>"Again?" Deputy Sam Payton asked, his voice thick with amusement. "Did you let your mom hire this employee?"<br><br>Nina carefully backed out of the driveway. Jerry's humor she could handle. He'd lived here all his life-he was allowed to tease her. But Sam was relatively new. He hadn't earned mocking rights.<br><br>"Hey, tax-paying citizen here, reporting a crime," she said.<br><br>"Yeah, yeah. I'm writing it down. What'd she take?"<br><br>"I didn't ask. She's at the pawn shop. Too Good To Be True."<br><br>"I know it," Deputy Sam told her. "I'll head out and see what's what."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>She hung up before he could offer advice on hiring policies and turned up the hill. The morning was clear-odd for early spring in the Pacific Northwest. Normally the good weather didn't kick in until closer to summer. To the west, blue water sparkled. To the east was western Washington.<br><br>As she climbed higher and higher, the view got better, but when she parked across from the three Queen Anne houses at the very top of the hill, pausing to enjoy the spectacular combination of sky and ocean was the last thing on her mind.<br><br>She hurried up the steps to the front porch that was both her boss's home and her office. Dr. Andi, as she was known, was a popular pediatrician on the island. Make that the <em>only</em> pediatrician. She'd moved here a year ago, opened her practice in September and had been thriving ever since. She was also a newlywed and as of two months ago, pregnant.<br><br>Nina unlocked the front door and stepped inside. She flipped on lights as she went, confirmed the temperature on the thermostat and then started the three computers in the front office.<br><br>After storing her purse in her locker, she logged into the scheduling program and saw that the first appointment of the day had canceled. Andi would appreciate the extra time to get herself moving. She was still battling morning sickness.<br><br>Nina did a quick check of her e-mail, forwarded several items to the bookkeeper/office manager, then walked to the breakroom for coffee. Less than five minutes after she'd arrived, she was climbing the stairs to her boss's private quarters.<br><br>Nina knocked once before entering. She found Andi, a tall, pretty brunette with curly hair, sitting at the table in the kitchen. Her arms cradled her head.<br><br>"Still bad?" Nina asked, walking to the cupboard.<br><br>"Hi and yes. It's not that I throw up, it's that I feel like I'm going to every single second." She raised her head and drew in a breath. "Are you drinking coffee?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"I miss coffee. I'm a wreck. I need to talk to my parents about my ancestors. Obviously I don't come from hardy stock."<br><br>Nina took down a mug, filled it with water and put it in the microwave. Then she collected a tea bag from the pantry.<br><br>"Not ginger tea," Andi said with a moan. "Please. I hate it."<br><br>"But it helps."<br><br>"I'd rather feel sick."<br><br>Nina raised her eyebrows.<br><br>Andi slumped in her seat. "I'm such a failure. Look at me. I'm carrying around a child the size of a lima bean and I'm throwing a hissy fit. It's embarrassing."<br><br>"And yet the need to act mature doesn't seem to be kicking in."<br><br>Andi smiled. "Funny how that works."<br><br>The microwaved dinged. Nina dropped the tea bag into the steaming water and crossed to the table.<br><br>The eat-in kitchen was open, with painted cabinets and lots of granite. The big window by the table took advantage of the east-facing views in the old house. The mainland shimmered only a few miles away.<br><br>Andi had bought the house-one of three up on the hill- when she'd moved to Blackberry Island. Undeterred by the broken windows and outdated plumbing, she'd had the house restored from the framework out. During the process, she'd fallen in love with her contractor. Which had led to her current tummy problems.<br><br>"Your first appointment canceled," Nina told her.<br><br>"Thank God." Andi sniffed the tea, then wrinkled her nose and took a sip. "It's the ginger. If I could have tea without ginger I think I could get it down."<br><br>"The thing is, the ginger is the part that settles your stomach."<br><br>"Life is perverse like that." Andi took another sip, then smiled. "I like the shirt."<br><br>Nina glanced down at the pattern. "Betty and I go way back."<br><br>One of the advantages of working for a pediatrician was that cheerful attire was encouraged. She had a collection of brightly colored fun shirts in her closet. It wasn't high fashion but it helped the kids smile and that was what mattered.<br><br>"I need to get back downstairs," she said. "Your first appointment is now at eight-thirty."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>Nina rose and started toward the stairs.<br><br>"Are you busy after work?" Andi asked.<br><br>Nina thought about the fact that she was going to have to go by the pawn shop and pick up what Tanya had tried to sell, then spend several hours at Blackberry Preserves, her family's antique store, figuring out what had been stolen, then tell her mother what had happened and possibly lecture her on the importance of actually following up on a potential employee's references. Only she'd been lecturing her mother for as long as she could remember and the lessons never seemed to stick. No matter how many times Bonnie promised to do better, she never did. Which left Nina picking up the pieces.<br><br>"I kind of am. Why?"<br><br>"I haven't been to Pilates in a week," Andi said. "It's important I keep exercising. Would you go with me? It's more fun when you're along."<br><br>"I can't tonight, but Monday's good."<br><br>Andi smiled. "Thanks, Nina. You're the best."<br><br>"Give me a plaque and I'll believe it."<br><br>"I'll order one today."<br><br>Nina counted out the number of happy fruit and vegetable stickers she had. Just enough, but she would have to order more.<br><br>Since opening her practice, Andi had started a program of inviting local elementary school classes into her office as a field trip. Kids learned about a basic exam, were able to use the stethoscope and check their weight and height in a non-threatening atmosphere. Andi's goal was to make a visit to the doctor less stressful.<br><br>Nina handled the scheduling and conducted the tour. Each student left with a small goodie bag filled with the stickers, a small coloring book on different ways to exercise and a box of crayons.<br><br>Normally the gift bags were filled by their receptionist before the event, but she had forgotten the stickers last time so Nina had taken over the task.<br><br>She was in the middle of lining up the open goodie bags for quick filling when her cell phone buzzed. She pulled it from her pocket and checked the name, then pushed speaker and set it on the breakroom table.<br><br>"Hi, Mom."<br><br>"Sweetheart! How are you? We're fine, but you were right, as you usually are."<br><br>Nina grabbed crayons from the big bag of them on the chair. "Right about what?"<br><br>"The tires. That we should have replaced them before we left. We had snow last night."<br><br>Nina glanced out the window at the sunny skies. She could see a few clouds pilling up against the horizon. Rain later that afternoon, she thought.<br><br>"Where are you?"<br><br>"Montana. It was coming down like you wouldn't believe. We had about four inches and the tires just couldn't handle it. We skidded off the road. We're fine now. Bertie found a Les Schwab store and the man there was just as nice as the one back home."<br><br>Nina sank onto the only free chair in the breakroom. "You were in a car accident?"<br><br>"No. We skidded. Not to worry. We're fine. The new tires are very nice. We went to several estate sales and more antique stores than I can count. We're filling the van with so many beautiful things. You're going to love what we've found."<br><br>She kept talking. Nina closed her eyes and rubbed her temples, telling herself that her commitment to eat her brownies one at a time had not made any reference to wine and when she got home that night, she was taking a bath and having a glass. Then she'd have her breakdown.<br><br>Bonnie Wentworth had given birth to her oldest at sixteen. She hadn't settled down when she'd become a mother and she sure wasn't settled now. Bonnie and her partner, Bertie, traveled the country on "buying trips" for their antique store. Antique being defined very loosely in this case. Junk was probably more accurate, but even Nina avoided the "j" word as much as possible.<br><br>She drew in a breath as her mother talked about a handmade doll Bertie had found.<br><br>"Mom, Tanya was caught trying to sell inventory to Jerry this morning."<br><br>Bonnie paused. "No," she said, sounding stunned. "I don't believe it."<br><br>Nina resisted the need to point out that Bonnie never believing it was the main problem.<br><br>"This is why I want to do the interviewing. Or if not me, than at least let Bertie do it."<br><br>"Are you sure she wasn't selling something of her own?" Bonnie asked. "She seemed like such a nice girl. I hate to think of her doing something like that."<br><br>"Me, too. You know this means the store's closed." Again.<br><br>There was silence. "Do you want us to come back? We could be there in a couple of days."<br><br>"No. I'll find someone."<br><br>Nina knew that if she asked, her mother would come home and run the store while they found someone. But then Nina would feel guilty, like she did now. And for the life of her, she couldn't figure out why.<br><br>"Sweetheart, you take on too much."<br><br>Nina opened her mouth and closed it. Right. Mostly because no one else was here to do it. "Mom, it's fine. But we need someone in the store who's responsible and can work without stealing."<br><br>"You're right. There must be someone and I'm sure you'll find her."<br><br>"I will. Did you call on the roof? Is the guy coming out to fix it?"<br><br>"I did call." Her mother sounded triumphant. "It's taken care of."<br><br>"Great. Thanks."<br><br>"You're welcome. I love you, sweetheart."<br><br>"I love you, too, Mom."<br><br>"I'll call in a few days. By then we should know when we'll be home. Bye."<br><br>Nina heard the click and knew her mother had hung up. Before she returned to the goodie bags, she called the local paper.<br><br>"Hi, Ellen, it's Nina Wentworth."<br><br>The old woman cackled. "Let me guess. You need someone to work at Blackberry Preserves. I have the information from the last ad, which is the same as the one before and the one before that. Want me to run it?"<br><br>Nina glanced out the window again. The storm clouds were closer. She could see a bit of the Sound and wondered if she got on a boat right now, where she would end up.<br><br>"That would be great," she said instead. "Thanks Ellen."<br><br>"You know, Nina, you've got to stop letting your mama hire people for that store."<br><br>Nina tightened her grip on the phone. "Yes, I know."<br><br>Nina stared at the items in the box. The candlesticks were silver and actually worth something. There were also several pieces of jewelry, a few with gems. The painting was a cheap reproduction and worth less than the frame, but still.<br><br>Jerry nodded as she inventoried the haul. "I was thinking the same thing," he told her. "How could a girl smart enough to know what to steal be dumb enough to come to me? Why didn't she just drive over the bridge and head toward Seattle? Another forty minutes in the car and she could have had the cash and been on her way."<br><br>"That's exactly what I was thinking," she admitted. "But I'm glad she was impatient. Was Sam Peyton by?"<br><br>"Yup. He took pictures. He said he needs to know what the candlesticks are worth." Jerry, a chubby, balding man in his sixties, nodded knowingly. "If it's over five grand, then Miss Tanya has committed a Class B felony. If she gets the maximum, it's a ten year prison sentence with a twenty thousand dollar fine."<br><br>"You're very knowledgeable about felonies and the law."<br><br>"In my business, it pays to know that sort of thing."<br><br>Nina picked up the box of items from the store. "I'm going to have to call Sam, aren't I? He's going to tell me I can't sell these until the case against Tanya is settled, right?"<br><br>"I wouldn't be surprised," Jerry told her.<br><br>Great. So the only items of value in the store were now going to be held hostage. She started for the door. "Thanks, Jerry."<br><br></p><h2>I Love You, Good Night</h2><p>First published in 1988, a sweet bedtime story shows a mother and son mouse trading lyrical &#34;love you forever&#34; affirmations before the son settles in for his sleep.</p><p>In this quiet bedtime read-together book, a mother and daughter take turns saying how much they love each other.

In <b>Saying Kaddish</b>, she shows how to make Judaism's time-honored rituals into personal, meaningful sources of comfort. Diamant guides the reader through Jewish practices that attend the end of life, from the sickroom to the funeral to the week, month, and year that follow. There are chapters describing the traditional Jewish funeral and the customs of <i>Shiva</i>, the first week after death when mourners are comforted and cared for by community, friends, and family. She also explains the protected status of Jewish mourners, who are exempt from responsibilities of social, business, and religious life during <i>Shloshim</i>, the first thirty days.

Even as the recent financial downturn threatens to cripple small businesses and privately owned farms, a stunning number of food-based businesses have grown in the region.&nbsp;<i>The Town That Food Saved</i>&nbsp;is rich with appealing, colorful characters, from the optimistic upstarts creating a new agricultural model to the long-established farmers wary of the rapid change in the region.<br><br>Hewitt, a journalist and Vermonter, delves deeply into the repercussions of this groundbreaking approach to growing food, both its astounding successes and potential limitations. The captivating story of an unassuming community and its extraordinary determination to build a vibrant local food system,&nbsp;<i>The Town That Food Saved</i>&nbsp;is grounded in ideas that will revolutionize the way we eat and, quite possibly, the way we live.</p><p>BEN HEWITT is the author of <i>The Town That Food Saved</i>, and the upcoming <i>Making Supper Safe</i>, and articles for magazines such as <i>Bicycling, Discover, Gourmet, Men's Journal, National Geographic Adventure, Outside</i>, the<i> New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Yankee</i> and many others. He and his family live in a self-built, solar-powered house in Cabot, Vermont, and operate a 40-acre livestock, vegetable, and berry farm.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>If you come into the town of Hardwick, Vermont, from the east, you come in on Route 15, weaving through a series of curves that begin as gentle sweeps and become progressively sharper until you find yourself leaning in your seat, the view through your windshield tilted just a few degrees off its axis. That's the Lamoille River on your right, gurgling and churning over water-worn stone and gravel; it cuts a course through the center of town, and there's a nice little walking bridge that crosses the water. It's on Main Street. It's not hard to find.<br><br>On your left, the land rises steeply from the highway's shoulder. It's mostly wooded, but just outside town, you can see where the hillside washed away a few years back; it's since been reinforced with a massive pile of rocks, but the homes visible at its crest still look disturbingly vulnerable, as if the slightest shift will send them bouncing down the hill to splinter across the roadway.<br><br>Hardwick sits in a shallow hollow; the town and its 3,200 residents live in the shadow cast by Buffalo Mountain, which rises to nearly 3,000 feet at the southwest corner of town. Buffalo Mountain is at once craggy and lush, populated by a mix of eastern hard-woods: birch, beech, ash, and the state's vaunted sugar maple. There is no road to the top, although all- terrain vehicle trails crisscross its flanks.<br><br>If you claw your way to the top of Buffalo Mountain and look out over the town, you'll see how Route 15 becomes Main Street, and Main Street lasts for about a quarter-mile before it hits the town's only traffic light, which consists of a single flashing orb at the junctions of Routes 14 and 15. If you turn right, continuing on 15, you'll immediately pass the former home of the Amateur Boxing Club, a garage, a gun shop, a pizza house, and a lumberyard, in that order. A bit farther out, there's a bank and a tractor- repair business. A Ford dealership. A gas station. If you go straight through the light onto 14 South, you'll pass two auto-parts stores, a school, a cemetery, and a series of modest residences. In either direction, you'll see how you could drive through Hardwick in two minutes or less, pushing on the accelerator as the speed limit rises again to 50 and the road unfurls across the lush Vermont countryside, drawing you in and on, helping you forget about the small town you just left behind.<br><br>Here's what you won't see: Over the past three years, this little hard-luck burg with a median income 25 percent below the state average and an unemployment rate nearly 40 percent higher has embarked on a quest to create the most comprehensive, functional, and downright vibrant local food system in North America. In the process, Hardwick, Vermont, just might prove what advocates of a decentralized food system have been saying for years: that a healthy agriculture system can be the basis of communal strength, economic vitality, food security, and general resilience in uncertain times.<br><br>Indeed, the sudden growth in Hardwick's ag infrastructure has been nothing short of explosive, with numerous food-based businesses and organizations settling in the region, seeking to become a part of the town's answer to the vexing question of what a healthy food system should look like. Vermont Soy Company. High Mowing Organic Seeds. Jasper Hill Cheese. True Yogurt. Claire's Restaurant and Bar. Pete's Greens. Vermont Food Venture Center. The Center for an Agricultural Economy. The Highfields Center for Composting. Honey Garden Apiaries. While a few of these enterprises have been quietly operating and growing for the past 5 to 10 years, most of them have arrived in the past 3 years, bringing nearly 100 jobs to a region that very much needed 100 jobs.<br><br>No, you won't see this from the summit of Buffalo Mountain, but you can see it along Hardwick's block-long Main Street business district, where local food-based enterprises (Claire's Restaurant and Bar, the Buffalo Mountain Food Co-op, the Village Diner, the Center for an Agricultural Economy) dominate, in some cases inhabiting buildings that had long sat idle. This is not the end of it. Soon, the Vermont Food Venture Center, a shared-use commercial kitchen and product development, processing, packaging, and shipping facility, will open in Hardwick, providing a place for small-scale producers to create and distribute value-added goods made with local ingredients, saving them the massive expense and hassle of installing such a facility on their own properties. And the nonprofit Center for an Agricultural Economy recently purchased 15 acres of prime agricultural land only two blocks from downtown; plans call for establishing what the center has dubbed an Eco-Industrial Park, which will potentially include shared office space for the town's ag-based businesses, a year-round, indoor farmers' market, farm and garden demonstration sites, a communal composting operation, and rental plots for budding farmers.<br><br>The recent growth in Hardwick's ag-based commerce is notable for something else: These outfits are, by and large, operated by youthful entrepreneurs possessing a surprising degree of business acumen. These are not the back- to-the-land dropouts of the region's 1970s' homestead agricultural revolution, smoking joints, hand-milking goats, and bartering Grateful Dead bootlegs for bunches of warty carrots (well, okay, perhaps some of this is happening); these are, by and large, graduates of our nation's elite liberal arts colleges who have sought ways to apply their six-figure educations to occupations rooted in the soil. They spend their days tending livestock, fields of lettuce, and racks of cloth-bound cheddar and their evenings convening to quaff beers and brainstorm the next step forward for this little settlement that just might be the most important food town in the United States.<br><br>If that seems like an outsize claim for a small town with a hard-bitten reputation, one need only consider the most recent outbreak of bad food news. The rise in energy and fertilizer prices has led to double- or in some cases triple-digit food inflation. In early 2008, the price of rice nearly doubled . . . in a single month. Milk prices are up nearly 100 percent in two years; ditto for wheat and corn prices. And with the average piece of American food traveling nearly 1,500 miles from farm to table, it's likely to only get worse as finite fossil-fuel reserves continue to shrink. On average, every calorie that lands on your plate soaked up 11 calories of fossil-fuel energy as it was sown, grown, harvested, processed, and shipped. When the price of those 11 fossil-fuel calories doubles, then triples, and finally rises exponentially, the cost of that single calorie of nourishment will rise, too.<br><br>It's no great secret that over the past century, America's food system has become increasingly industrialized and centralized. It's an economy of scale that has served us well, at least in strictly economic terms. In 1930, the average American family spent 24.2 percent of its income on food. That number has declined in every single decade since; by 2007, it had fallen to 9.8 percent. Of course, there are hidden costs in the form of health problems wrought by processed foods and an agriculture industry that has become heavily reliant on subsidies paid out of your taxes. But the fact remains: Until very recently, our food has never been cheaper. It has also never been more corrosive to our health and environment.<br><br>There are other problems with our centralized food system. Most critically, it's vulnerable to energy-supply disruptions, terrorist attacks, widespread outbreaks of food-borne illness, and any unforeseen emergency that disrupts the constant flow of trains and trailers. And recent events suggest that it simply might not be able to keep up with a population that's growing at the rate of three million mouths annually. Consider this: In 2001, the United States had a $14.3 billion agricultural surplus. By 2005, that surplus had shrunk to $3.8 billion.<br><br>It might seem crazily, disturbingly pessimistic to think that the United States, a nation renowned for abundance, could run short of food. But in 2007, driven by drought, biofuels, and the simple limits of soil, global grain stocks declined to a level not seen in 34 years. Given that 2008 saw continued drought in major grain-producing nations such as Australia and biblical flooding in the midwestern United States, it's unlikely the situation will resolve itself soon. In fact, much of the steep run-up in rice prices last spring was due to many rice-exporting nations exporting less. The result wasn't merely an expensive pot of rice; many Costco super- stores limited sales of the grain to their customers. That's right: Food rationing, in the United States, in 2008.<br><br>What conclusion might we draw from this? Unfortunately, it isn't pretty, because the fact is that our nation's food supply has never been more vulnerable. And we, as consumers of food, share that vulnerability, having slowly, inexorably relinquished control over the very thing that's most critical to our survival. We have become utterly dependent on a supply chain that is entirely beyond our control, in no small part because it typically starts a half-continent away. There is no single action, corporation, or agency that can secure this fragile infrastructure and deliver us a steady supply of nourishment. We could debate endlessly and vigorously over the root cause of this tragic disconnect, and perhaps there's some value in that. But the truth is, we've arrived at this crisis from many and varied directions. Is it the modern archetype of agriculture as a corporate entity, with its deep pockets and unquenchable appetite for profit? Yes. Is it the intricate web of governmental regulations and subsidies that have supported the food-as-a-commodity model? Yes. Is it the inexorable chipping away of our land and skills base, to the point where the vast majority of us no longer possess the means or the knowledge to produce even a head of lettuce? Yes. Is it our willingness to allow these things to slip through our fingers in favor of the ease of supermarket shopping? Yes.<br><br>The cheap-food boom has been seductively comfortable for us all. Let's face it: Farming is damn hard work, typically done for damnable pay. By relinquishing this burden, by handing the reins to the corporations, we relieved ourselves of a lot of backaches, sunburns, and financial strains. We struck a deal: The agribusinesses got a guaranteed chunk of our income and our full faith in their ability to keep us sustained. In return, we got to pursue lifestyles that don't revolve around soil and toil and that allow us a measure of leisure time unprecedented in human history. In early 2009, American television viewing reached an all-time record of a stunning 151 hours per month. That's more than five hours per day, and let's be clear about something: You and I don't get to sprawl across the sofa masticating pork rinds and watching American Idol unless someone else is growing the food.<br><br>As long as the corporations keep their end of the bargain, it's a pretty sweet deal, presuming one overlooks the pallid, depleted nature of the foodstuffs they're providing. But it's becoming increasingly obvious that they won't be able to hold up their end of the bargain forever or, if recent events are any indication, even for much longer. This leaves us facing a rather daunting truth: The fact is that we need to rethink our entire food-supply chain for reasons of economic security, health security, and even social security. We need to reinvent how we grow and distribute food; we need to re-scale and decentralize.<br><br>It is hard to grasp the enormity of this task on a national scale. It is no less challenging or important than wrenching our economy and way of life from the clutches of petroleum. And yet there has been no consensus on the issue; indeed, there has been little in the way of serious debate among anyone beyond the growing but still very much in the minority community of locavores who bounce around farmers' markets with their reusable organic- cotton satchels. To be sure, they are an important part of our agricultural renewal. But between them and a healthy national food system lie thousands and thousands of acres of corn and soy and wheat sown in depleted soils and coaxed to life with chemical fertilizers, waiting to be harvested, amalgamated into shelf-stable concoctions, packaged, and trucked to a nation of people who have already forgotten it wasn't always like this. And who can't imagine that it won't always remain so.<br><br>To understand how Hardwick has gotten to this place and to know where it might go from here, it is necessary to understand where it has been. In many ways, it is not unlike scores of other rural communities scattered throughout the American landscape, built on industries that long ago packed up their bags and left. In Hardwick, that industry was granite, and it's hard to overstate how much vibrancy, excitement, and money the stone provided the town. Over a period of three decades, spanning the late 1800s to the early 1920s, nearly 300 granite companies operated in the Hardwick area, mining the rock veins that run like spiderwebs throughout the surrounding hills. By 1918, the largest of these outfits, the Woodbury Granite Company, was the biggest granite operation in the world. It supplied the stone for the state capitols of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Chicago's City Hall and Cook County Courthouse. Even a cursory exploration of the region's densely wooded hills will reveal the century- old detritus of the trade: lengths of frayed and rusted cable, pieces of corroded metal shorn from some mysterious tool or another, impossibly heavy slabs of discarded stone jumbled together like a god's game of pickup sticks.<br><br>These were raucous times, marked by the swagger and pent-up energy of men who spent the week engaged in hazardous duty and needed to blow off a little steam on weekends before returning to the constant dangers of tumbling stone and the pervasive granite dust that caused silicosis-induced lung disease, known throughout the region as "stonecutter's tuberculosis." The accident reports of the day read like gruesome parodies of themselves, bearing phrases such as "crushed between stone blocks," "wound around machinery gearing," "crushed between two railroad cars," "struck by flying metal from an exploding steam boiler," and "premature quarry explosion." If you'd just maneuvered through your week without having had your name attached to one of these scenarios, you'd want to kick up your heels a little, too.</p><h2>John Pinto&#39;s Little Green Book of Ophthalmology (Strategies, Tips, and Pearls to Help You Grow and Manage a Practice of Distinction)</h2><p>This book is intended to assist ophthalmic practices in operating their practices.</p><p></p><h2>Allensworth, The Freedom Colony: A California African American Township</h2><p>In 1908, an escaped slave turned army officer named Colonel Allen Allensworth founded a small town in California's Central Valley where African Americans could thrive. Over the next decade some three hundred Black pioneers established a self-sufficient farming community with its own school, church, businesses, and municipal government. Although the community only flourished for a handful of years, it nonetheless became a symbol of the possibility of a fairer America in the era of Jim Crow.

Brisard wrote the 1st intelligence report on the bin Laden financial networks which was used to close down fraudulent Islamic charities funding terrorism, a report that President Jacques Chirac handed to George Bush on his visit to the US in the wake of 9/11. Forbidden Truth reveals that French intelligence gave the FBI unambiguous information that the so-called 20th hijacker, Zacarias Massaoui, was tied to Al Qaeda, a story Brisard broke to Salon magazine before Special Agent Coleen Rowley came out publicly to say the FBI stifled the investigation. John O'Neill the former head of the FBI's antiterrorism division--who perished in the World Trade Center--told Jean-Charles Brisard in 7/01, "All of the answers, all of the clues allowing us to dismantle Osama bin Laden's organization, can be found in Saudi Arabia." The result of three years of investigation by a leading French intelligence expert &amp; investigative journalist, Forbidden Truth is the untold story of the Clinton &amp; Bush attempts to stabilize Afghanistan so that US energy companies could build a pipeline. In particular, it details the secret hazardous diplomacy between the Bush administration &amp; the Taliban from February to August 2001--a story still untold in the US media--talks that ultimately led the US to make threats via Pakistani intermediaries to the Taliban in 7/01 that they were going to bomb Afghanistan if the Taliban didn't comply.</p><p></p><h2>Lee Friedlander: Self Portrait</h2><p>Lee Friedlander's surreal sensibility is on full display in this set of photographs, originally published in 1970.

I was born in New York, then grew up in Athens, Greece and North Grafton, Massachusetts. Started reading at age 3, discovered comics soon after. First comic collected and saved: Marvel's <i>Godzilla.</i> Never quit comics for girls the way some flip-floppers do, though I did keep it in the closet at times, for which I am deeply ashamed. Attended Brown University (here's a secret: the Ivy League is overrated) where I majored in American Civilization, a field that allowed me to take classes like The Blues and The Spy Novel, which have come in a lot handier in my life than algebra. Got a Master's Degree in Screenwriting from the American Film Institute. Sold my first screenplay in 1997 and have been a professional writer ever since, with several scripts sitting on shelves gathering dust and a few actually produced. Started writing comics in December 2004. Married to the lovely Southern firecracker Ruth Fletcher Gage, who is my writing partner in film and television, though she had enough sense to stay away from Teenage Caveman. We have plans to collaborate on two graphic novels in the future. We live with our cats, Frankie and Josie. The author lives in Santa Monica, CA..</p><h2>Seaweeds (Smithsonian&#39;s Natural World Series)</h2><p>From microscopic organisms on tidal rocks to dense marine forests, seaweeds vary widely in size and are amazingly well adapted to both the Arctic and the tropics. David Thomas presents a detailed look at what seaweeds are, how they live, and why humans value them.<br><br>Thomas describes the red, brown, and green classifications of seaweeds that encompass more than ten thousand species. He explains how seaweeds get all of their nutrients from the surrounding water, needing roots only to anchor to the sea floor, and how some species use &#x201c;anti-grazing&#x201d; strategies to discourage fish by releasing swift doses of unappetizing acids. The economic value of seaweed is astounding. Some species are harvested for $1 billion annually, and seaweed constitutes up to ten percent of the average diet in Japan. The search continues for compounds in seaweed that may be beneficial as new drugs, antibiotics, and cancer treatments. Not only is seaweed vital to coastal ecosystems, but it is also an important part of everyday life.</p><p><b>David Thomas</b> is a senior lecturer at the University of Wales in England. He has worked with and studied seaweed for twenty years.</p><h2>Moors Account</h2><p>In 1527 the Spanish conquistador Panfilo de Narvaez arrived on the coast of modern-day Florida with hundreds of settlers, and claimed the region for Spain. Almost immediately, the expedition was decimated by a combination of navigational errors, disease, starvation and fierce resistance from indigenous tribes. Within a year, only four survivors remained: three noblemen and a Moroccan slave called &#34;Estebanico&#34;. The official record, set down after a reunion with Spanish forces in 1536, contains only the three freemen&#39;s accounts. The fourth, to which the title of Laila Lalami&#39;s masterful novel alludes, is Estebanico&#39;s own. Lalami gives us Estebanico as history never did: as Mustafa, the vibrant merchant from Azemmur forced into slavery and a new name, and reborn as the first black explorer of the Americas, discovering and being discovered by various tribes both hostile and compassionate. In Estebanico&#39;s telling, the survivors&#39; journey across great swathes of the New World transforms would-be conquerors into humble servants and fearful outcasts into faith healers. He remains ever-observant, resourceful and hopeful that he might one day find his way back to his family, even as he experiences an unexpected (if ambiguous) camaraderie with his masters. The Moor&#39;s Account illuminates the ways in which stories can transmigrate into history, and how storytelling can offer a chance for redemption, reinvention and survival.</p><p>Laila Lalami is the author of two other novels, Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits and Secret Son, longlisted for the Orange Prize. Her essays and opinion pieces have appeared in The Guardian and The New York Times, among other publications. She is the recipient of a British Council Fellowship, and is currently an associate professor of creative writing at the University of California at Riverside.<b>8.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b><i>The Story of Seville</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> All around me, voices rose and fell. Shackled slaves spoke in an overlapping multitude of languages, this one asking after an uncle, this other comforting a child, and yet these others arguing about a piece of moldy bread, their cries periodically interrupted by the bleating of goats from the animal stalls. But for a long time, I kept to my silence, wrapping myself in it like an old, comfortable cloak. I think I was still trying to apprehend the consequences of what I had done. For hours on end, I revisited the long sequence of events that had led me from the soft divans and rhythmic guenbris of my graduation feast to the timber bench and jangling chains of the caravel Jacinta, sailing with frightening speed toward the city of Seville. I had played my part in these events&#x2014;I had made my decisions freely and independently at each juncture, and yet I was stunned by the turn my life had taken. The elders teach us: give glory to God, who can alter all fates. One day you could be selling slaves, the next you could be sold as a slave.<br> &nbsp;<br> The hunger I had felt so keenly in Azemmur was tamed now, if not satisfied, by the hard bread the sailors distributed once a day, though it was quickly replaced by a renewed acquaintance with all of my body&#x2019;s other senses and needs. My head itched from the lice my neighbor, an old man with pockmarks dotting his face, had given me. My soiled clothes stuck to my skin, because I could not bring myself to use, on command and with little notice, the bucket that was passed up and down the gallery twice a day. My limbs grew stiff from sitting in damp and narrow quarters. My throat hurt, my feet swelled, my wrists bled. Above all, my heart ached with longing for my family.<br> &nbsp;<br> My family. They had, all of them, learned to accept their fates. Without complaint my sister had spent her girlhood watching over our twin brothers, and without protest she had returned home after her divorce. My brothers went to school every day hoping to fulfill my father&#x2019;s dreams, dreams I had cruelly broken and then bequeathed to them. My mother had left her beloved people and her distinguished hometown in order to follow my father to Azemmur.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for me, I had made a habit of defying my fate. Perhaps I could do that now and find a way back to my old life. I thought of the elder al-Dib, my employer in Azemmur, who had been born to a slavewoman, but had earned his freedom as a youth. Perhaps I could do the same. Perhaps my talent would be recognized by my master, who would let me purchase my freedom; or perhaps my misery would touch the heart of an Andalusian Muslim, who would free me from bondage in order to earn the favor of our Lord. To overcome my fear, I shackled myself with hope, its links heavier than any metal known to man.<br> &nbsp;<br> Having convinced myself that my condition was temporary, I set about trying to survive it. I taught myself to ignore the stench of excretions, the moans of delirium, the sight of private parts. I learned to push back into my throat the rising taste of vomit. I tried to watch out for the rats. I slept only when my exhaustion overpowered my discomfort. And I passed the time by listening to the stories the women told their children, after the guards had left and the doors were locked for the night. In the darkness of the lower deck, the women brought to life a world entire, a world where sly girls outwitted hungry ghouls and where simple cobblers saved powerful sultans, so that at times it seemed to me I could see the ghouls&#x2019; sharp teeth or the sultan&#x2019;s embroidered slippers.<br><br> Then, early one morning, the anchor was dropped, its tug faintly resonating through the varnished wood under my feet. I listened to the footsteps on the upper deck. Did the customs officer come aboard to greet the captain? Was that the stevedore inquiring about the merchandise? Then at last the deck door was flung wide open. A rush of cold air blasted into the lower deck, where it met with the suppressed heat and terrified silence of two hundred slaves. Row by row, we were unshackled and led up the stairs.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I reached the upper deck, the blinding white light made me recoil in pain and I staggered like a drunkard, but after three weeks in closed quarters I was so hungry for the untainted smell of open air that I took my hands off my face. Seville reeked of fried fish, but its air was not briny, and there was a whiff of smoke coming from somewhere in the port. The morning chill gave me goose bumps and I put my arms around me, all the while steadying myself on my feet. Finally, I opened my eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> All around me were men whose faces were covered in brightly colored kerchiefs, with openings for the eyes. They carried long sticks, with which they prodded me to the way out. As I went down the ship&#x2019;s rope ladder, I saw that I was on a wide river. It ran fast, just like the Umm er-Rbi&#x2019;, and yet its sound, the particular melody it made as it rumbled beneath the ship, was different. Later, when I would learn that this river was called the Guadalquivir, the Arabic name would at once delight me with its familiarity and repulse me with its reminder of my personal humiliation. The city of Seville did not have a pier like the one in Azemmur, so we had to be taken by rowboat to the riverbank. The sky above was a turquoise blue, cut through by the black masts and white sails of the ships <br> around us.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the shore, a man whose face was hidden behind a yellow kerchief was separating the healthy from the lame, the sturdy from the weak, the young from the old. He jabbed me with a stick, and then pointed me to the first line. All around me, the port hummed with the sounds of sailors, officers, porters, and scribes, each hurriedly going about his business. Two men standing next to a tall stack of crates were having a loud argument, I remember, and one of them seized the other by his collar. Beyond the port, the city&#x2019;s white, square homes were slowly rising from their slumber. Carts creaked on the cobblestone. Horses clopped in the distance. Somewhere, I knew, a father was sitting down for a morning meal with his family. Somewhere, a child was receiving her bowl of milk. Somewhere, a brother was closing the door of his house behind him as he went to work. And I was here, at the port, ready to be sold once again.<br> &nbsp;<br> A man with a red kerchief grouped a dozen of us together, the way farmers collect their eggs or bakers their loaves, tied our hands to one another with thick rope, and led us away from the port. It was a long and painful walk, because we were all weak from hunger and idleness. Periodically one of us fell and had to be helped up, but our wretched procession drew no stares of interest or curiosity from the many people we passed. Each one went about his business without the slightest pause. At a bend in the road I caught the first glimpse of an imposing tower, which looked very much like the minarets at home. What is the name of that tower? I asked the man with the red kerchief. La Giralda, he said without turning. I had heard of La Giralda years earlier&#x2014;it had been built by the Almohad sultans as a replica of the Kutubiya in Marrakesh&#x2014;and I had even fantasized of seeing it someday, but never under these circumstances.<br> &nbsp;<br> Around the corner from La Giralda, we stopped in front of a tall edifice, with large wooden doors and an imposing facade. As we ascended the marble steps, an older man in our group slipped and fell and we all tumbled in a pile over him. The slave merchant clicked his tongue at the delay we were causing him&#x2014;his long day, already filled with labor, was made more difficult by our clumsiness. The fallen man stood up, his palm over his broken tooth and bloodied lips, even as the merchant pulled roughly on the rope and led us toward the entrance.<br> &nbsp;<br> We were brought before an imam of the Christian faith, a man of freckled complexion and colorless eyes, who spoke an ancient tongue I did not understand. I could detect no pattern to the words that poured like a river out of his mouth, but I listened nonetheless, to distract myself from my thirst and my hunger. He wore a robe of immaculate white, with carefully embroidered edges. Behind him, a stained glass window colored the morning light in various shades of red, yellow, and blue. Though I had been taught to distrust pictures of the human form, I could not help staring at the white woman with a babe in arms and the brilliantly attired men gathered around her. They seemed removed from our untidy and disgraceful world, engaged in their own story, unconcerned about the scene unfolding beneath them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Being the tallest man in my family, I was used to lowering my head when I passed through the doorway of our house and to seeing my knees stick out when I sat on my heels next to my uncles. Yet here, in this high-ceilinged church, I felt small and helpless. My hands were tied together and bound to the slaves on either side of me. If one of us moved his hands or feet in order to find a more comfortable stance, the slave merchant pulled on the rope to force the insurgent back in line. With a snap, the priest closed his book and laid it carefully on a table beside him. He nodded to the merchant, who nudged the first in our group forward, a woman with wide, protruding eyes. The priest&#x2019;s fingers traced a cross in the air, over her face and chest. I looked at him unblinkingly, all the while wondering what the action meant and why he repeated it with each one of us. It was not until much later that I understood the significance of the sign on our bodies. I had entered the church as the servant of God Mustafa ibn Muhammad ibn Abdussalam al-Zamori; I left it as Esteban. Just Esteban&#x2014;converted and orphaned in one gesture.<br> &nbsp;<br> The slave merchant led us out of the cathedral. He pulled his red kerchief back up over his nose to protect himself against the smell of his charges. Walking with the swiftness of a man determined to make the most of his day, he led us back to the port and to a holding pen guarded by dogs. In truth, there was no need for them since we were all so tired and hungry we would not have had the power to run far. The four women in our group went to huddle together on the far side of the holding pen. I had trouble speaking to them, on account of the fact that they spoke a different variety of Tamazight than I did, but by and by I gathered that they were the daughters of farmers who had suffered great hardship during the drought. Two of the men told me they were from Guinea and had been sold on the slave markets there, then transported to Azemmur, and from there to Seville. Just before nightfall, a man brought us bowls of cold soup. We called the name of God over our food, each in our own language and custom, and ate hungrily.<br> &nbsp;<br> I lay down on the pallet that, by the following morning, would give me a terrible rash, and tried to go to sleep. But sleep eluded me. In the distance, I could hear the Guadalquivir, and my thoughts drifted to Yahya, who, despite my repeated efforts, had not learned how to swim. He had never been able to conquer his fear of water long enough to wade into the heart of the Umm er-Rbi&#x2019;. How Yusuf would tease him! I tried to protect him from the taunts of the other boys as they swam in the river, but he always ended up in tears. Sometimes, during the mating season, a shad would fly out of the water, and I would try to catch it so that Yahya, seeing my feat, would finally want to leave the safety of the shore. But the fish were always too slippery for me and I was never able to pull off the trick. Would Yusuf teach him what I had not been able to?<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite the faint sound of the river, this strange city filled me with dread. I tossed and turned for a long while before I realized why it felt so quiet and so empty&#x2014;I had not heard the call for prayer. In Azemmur, I had heard it five times a day, every day of my life. The morning prayer woke me; the noon prayer told me that it was time to eat and rest; the afternoon prayer refreshed me after a long nap; the dusk prayer delivered me from my workday and to my family; and the evening prayer commended my soul to God. Now I was alone in the world. All I could do to contain the tears that welled in my eyes was to lie in the dark and call silently upon God until I fell asleep.<br><br>###</p><h2>Let&#39;s Join In: Four Stories</h2><p>Four stories, each about a simple verb--hiding, giving, chatting, and bouncing--show the many lively situations each experience can evoke, in a spirited volume with simple, rhythmic text and warm, realistic illustrations.</p><p>A friendly, round-faced little girl leads young readers (and near-readers) through four of the most pleasurable occupations known to humankind: hiding, giving, chatting, and bouncing. Because, really, is there any better way to pass time than chatting with the cat or bouncing on Daddy first thing in the morning? The stories in this collection focus on every aspect of the described activity, with unique kid's-eye perspectives. For example, the dog Buster "always hides when it's time for his bath, and so does Mom's wallet "when we're all ready to go shopping." The intense drama of a child's life is easy to overlook in the adult world of serious Issues. But British author and illustrator Shirley Hughes manages to get right in there and celebrate the truly important things: a baby giving his sister two soggy bread crusts, and a bunch of friends bouncing on big cushions. Hughes, a favorite among readers young and old, has once again captured the exquisite joy and humor of childhood. Her appealing illustrations invite readers to stay a while, just to explore the keenly observed colors and details. (Ages 4 to 7) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>The doyenne of children&#39;s literature, Shirley has won the Kate Greenaway Medal and the prestigious Eleanor Farjeon Award for her services to children&#39;s literature.</p><h2>Mr. Boston official bartender&#39;s guide</h2><p>Celebrating Mr. Boston&#39;s 50th Anniversary! For both the amateur and professional mixologist. What is interesting about the bartender guides from Mr. Boston is that you can pinpoint what was in fashion any given time period as the editions were frequently reprinted and revised; so there is an ability to pinpoint beverage history and to revise and revamp recipes not in a current issue and promote them as retro cocktails. The cocktails are listed alphabetically in a small compact hardbound book. These were not issued with dust jackets as they would not be needed in a bartending situation (beit home or establishment). Joseph DeSoto, the owner of the Boston Bartending School partnered with Old Boston Distillers after Leo Cotton (the original editor) ended his tenure with them. It was rare to find a bartender whom did not own a copy of this guide to help him or her accurately mix cocktails and to use as a reference in case an unfamiliar cocktail was called for. There is a Special Section which is a reference on the proper way to mix the drinks, bar hints and measurements, glassware, how to chill a glass, how to frost a glass, ice, sugar, when to stir, when to shake, using a strainer, pouring, how to float cordials, how to flame liquor, using eggs, using fruit juices and fruit, using bitters, peel twists, vermouth, a liquor dictionary and so much more.</p><p></p><h2>The Gatekeepers #5: Oblivion</h2><p>The final, thrilling conclusion to #1 New York Times bestselling author Anthony Horowitz's masterful series!<br><br>Matt.

Although he was thoroughly briefed on the historical background of the invasion, he was totally unprepared for how it would affect him emotionally. Flooded with childhood memories of World War II, Brokaw began asking veterans at the ceremony to revisit their past and talk about what happened, triggering a chain reaction of war-torn confessions and Brokaw's compulsion to capture their experiences in what he terms "the permanence a book would represent."<p> After almost 15 years and hundreds of letters and interviews, Brokaw wrote <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, a representative cross-section of the stories he came across. However, this collection is more than a mere chronicle of a tumultuous time, it's history made personal by a cast of everyday people transformed by extraordinary circumstances: the first women to break the homemaker mold, minorities suffering countless indignities to boldly fight for their country, infantrymen who went on to become some of the most distinguished leaders in the world, small-town kids who became corporate magnates. From the reminiscences of George Bush and Julia Child to the astonishing heroism and moving love stories of everyday people, <i>The Greatest Generation</i> salutes those whose sacrifices changed the course of American history. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>"A moving scrapbook...a tribute to the members of the World War II generation to whom we Americans and the world owe so much." <br>-- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Full of wonderful, wrenching tales of a generation of heroes.

Learn how to distinguish a genuine historic find from an ordinary attic specimen, how to &#34;steal&#34; fabric from one part of a quilt to replace another, and how Victorian Crazy Quilts can be fixed by insetting embroidered patches without perforating the fragile silk.</p><p></p><h2>By His Grace, God&#39;s Plan of Salvation</h2><p><p>The purpose of this book is to share with the reader some of the revelations I have received through God's Holy Spirit and show how the truth of God's Word can direct our steps as we walk on the road of life. It is not meant to be taken as a replacement for the Word of God. Nothing can take the place of the holy scriptures for they are God's authoritative mandates for all mankind. It is only meant to be a supplement to be used by the Holy Spirit of God to reveal His truth to those who are interested in learning more about how we are delivered from death and an eternity of pain and suffering. All through this book, I will share passages from God's Word that will highlight the truth of his Word and help you understand his grace and his plan of deliverance. I will also share information from <em>Strong's Concordance</em> to shed light on the meanings of words spoken by God's Holy Spirit. It is my hope that the truth revealed in his Word will excite, enlighten, and inspire you to seek his grace. I pray they will further inspire you to refuse the self-centered and self-willed decisions we face every day and help you grasp God's truth and practice his perfect will in your life. It is also my hope and prayer that you will choose a life full of God's purpose and commit and dedicate your life to Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God and the Savior of all mankind.</p></p><p>This book seeks to do only three things:1) To lift up and exalt the name of Jesus Christ as God&#39;s only begotten Son and proclaim Him as the Savior of all mankind.2) To illustrate the true meaning of God&#39;s Grace and how we are saved by His Grace.3) To stress the importance of the &#34;Born Again&#34; experience that Jesus declared as necessary.</p><h2>Medusa&#39;s Child</h2><p><b>Everything in America is about to stop... 10,000 feet over Washington, D.C.!</b><br><br>With the same breathtaking heroics that brought his bestselling <i>Pandora's Clock</i> international acclaim, John J. Nance once again spins today's headlines--this time about the threat of nuclear terrorism--into an all-too-realistic story of high-flying suspense.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>For thirty-year-old captain Scott McKay, the transport run from Miami to Denver will give him the money he desperately needs to keep his fledgling air cargo company flying.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a mysterious crate is discovered on his plane, however, McKay is ordered to abandon his present course and fly the crate and its owner, Vivian Henry, to Washington, D.C., before going to Denver.&nbsp;&nbsp;McKay takes the forced detour in stride--until a strange noise comes from deep inside the crate.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the voice of Vivian's husband, Dr. Rogers Henry, warning that the shipment they are carrying is actually a fully armed Medusa device, a thermonuclear bomb that can destroy every computer chip over an entire continent, and blast the Silicon Age back to the Stone Age.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is set to go off within hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As panic spreads from the small community of nuclear scientists who used to work for Dr. Rogers Henry to the White House and eventually to the general public, a group of rogue military officers conspires to disobey the President's orders and secure the technology of the Medusa device, whatever the cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Captain McKay and his crew trust their own instincts to dispose of the bomb, or will they let a misguided government dictate their actions? <br><br>Using his inside knowledge of the airline industry, as well as his expertise as a pilot, John J.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nance has once again turned our worst fears into a terrifyingly realistic story.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Medusa's Child</i> will take readers into the center of a spine-tingling crisis.</p><p>If you miss the great airborne adventures of writers like the late Ernest K. Gann, John Nance might help take up some of the slack. His Pandora&#39;s Clock--it became a TV movie--featured a nasty virus rampant at 35,000 feet. His latest has the widow of a world-class scientist trying to deliver to the Pentagon an invention that could shut down computers everywhere, thus ending civilization (and online bookselling) as we know it. Lots of hairy, if somewhat implausible, action--sure to be exploited in another TV movie.<b>A new novel of airborne suspense by the bestselling author of <i>Pandora's Clock!</i></b><p><i>Praise for John J.

Nonetheless, the writer continually finds herself in transit, often accompanying her husband, a doctor, on business-related excursions to such locations as Cairo, Guatemala and Thailand. In writing, her eye zeroes in on odd situations, and is not easily dazzled: sailing to the Great Barrier Reef, she speaks disdainfully of her boisterous Australian shipmates, then sheepishly realizes their genuine kindness; high on a Swiss mountain after dark, she encounters tour guides who expect her and her fellow travelers to toboggan down a steep slope to their hotel; in AIDS-ravaged Tanzania, she witnesses an immense herd of wildebeest ("So many, and yet each an individual . . . they were like humanity itself"). Johnson writes lyrically, using wry humor and biting criticism. Her honest observations of human nature and sharp, unapologetic style prove refreshing, though at times she takes for granted the privilege of mobility. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Anyone with a penchant for travel will be delighted in these ten slice-of-life travel essays by Johnson. Whether discovering the mysteries of the Great Barrier Reef, observing wildlife on the Serengeti, or accompanying her physician husband on excursions abroad, Johnson brings alive her experiences and encounters with people and places. One of the most appealing features of the book is Johnson's conversational style of writing. She writes as if she is relaying events to a good friend. Natural Opium is an excellent choice for any library's travel section, due to the diversity of locations covered, the caliber of writing, and the book's absorbing entertainment qualities.<br><i>- Jo-Anne Mary Benson, Osgoode, Ontario</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Do Men Know What They Want: Never Satisfied Second Edition</h2><p>The second edition of the Never Satisfied Series, Do Men Know What They Want is a collection of interviews conducted by Best Selling Author and Nationally Syndicated Radio Personality, Michael Baisden, about how men feel about sex, relationships, and monogamy.

The trip starts out fine, although a few spooky stories and her lack of outdoor experience have Callie on edge. Things begin to go south when the group gets hopelessly lost and it becomes obvious that there is someone following them. When the group meets a solo hiker who claims to know how to get to a trail and a cabin, they agree to follow him. Yet things continue downhill as their food dwindles, their trust of one another and their mysterious guide wears thin, and whatever is stalking them is closing in and threatening their lives. Most chapters end on a cliff-hanger, and entries from the stalker's "Recovery Journal" are interspersed throughout, so readers know that there is a killer but don't know the identity. Scott builds constant tension, and the novel's events unfold like a horror movie. There is some violence and a high body count, so this title is not for the faint of heart.

Ostensibly written by Judas's son, Benjamin, and following the narrative style of the Gospels, this re-creation is provocative, compelling, and controversial.<br><i>The Gospel According to Judas, by Benjamin Iscariot</i> is the result of an intense collaboration between a storyteller and a scholar: Jeffrey Archer<i> </i>and Francis J. Moloney.<i> </i>Their brilliant work--bold and simple--is&nbsp;a compelling story for twenty-first-century readers, while maintaining an authenticity that&nbsp;would be&nbsp;credible to a first-century Christian or Jew.<br></p><p><br><br>Jeffrey Archer is an internationally bestselling writer whose books have sold more than 125 million copies worldwide. Prof. Francis J. Moloney is a widely respected scholar, educator, and priest, and the author of 36 books both scholarly and popular, many of which are about the gospel.<br><br>Not to be confused with the historic <i>Gospel of Judas</i> (2006, National Geographic), this is a novella by Benjamin Iscariot&#x2014;a fictionalized son of Judas who is eager to rehabilitate his father's reputation. This collaboration between novelist Archer and Roman Catholic theologian Moloney changes a few things from the traditional story, e.g., refuting the notion that Judas committed suicide and attributing his betrayal of Jesus to the altruistic motive of trying to save his master's life. But surprisingly, this fictionalized gospel doesn't have enough fiction; it hews so closely to the chronology and cadence of the New Testament that character development suffers. And although the gospel adds some meticulously researched historical background, helping readers understand the context of first-century Judaism, other features that are prominent in the New Testament record&#x2014;particularly miracles, healings, and the resurrection&#x2014;are almost nonexistent. Desmond Tutu's voice is marvelous in the narration, his lilting South African cadence breathing life into a disappointingly staid text.

From Djuna&#x2019;s story, told in &#x201c;The Sealed Room&#x201d; through hints and allusions, hazy in their details and chronology, the most important event to emerge is her father&#x2019;s desertion (like Nin&#x2019;s) when she was sixteen. By rejecting realistic writing for the experience and intuitions she drew from her diary, Nin was able to forge a novelistic style emphasizing free association, spontaneity, and improvisation, a technique that finds its parallel in the jazz music performed at the caf� where Nin&#x2019;s characters meet.</p></p><p>Children of the Albatross is divided into two sections: &#39;The Sealed Room&#39; focuses on the dancer Djuna and a set of characters, chiefly male, who surround her; &#39;The Cage&#39; brings together a case of characters already familiar to Nin&#39;s readers, but it is their meeting place that is the focal point of the story.<p><b>Ana�s Nin</b> (1903&#x2013;1977) is an iconic literary figure and one of the most notable experimental writers of the twentieth century.

Over the past 30 years activities that previous generations of children enjoyed without a second thought have been relabelled as troubling or dangerous, and the adults who permit them branded as irresponsible. &#34;No Fear&#34; argues that childhood is being undermined by the growth of risk aversion and its intrusion into every aspect of children&#39;s lives. This restricts children&#39;s play, limits their freedom of movement, corrodes their relationships with adults and constrains their exploration of physical, social and virtual worlds.Focusing on the crucial years of childhood between the ages of 5 and 11 - from the start of statutory schooling to the onset of adolescence - &#34;No Fear&#34; examines some of the key issues with regard to children&#39;s safety: playground design and legislation, antisocial behaviour, bullying, child protection, the fear of strangers and online risks. It offers insights into the roles of parents, teachers, carers, the media, safety agencies and the Government and exposes the contradictions inherent in current attitudes and policies, revealing how risk-averse behaviour ironically can damage and endanger children&#39;s lives. In conclusion, &#34;No Fear&#34; advocates a philosophy of resilience that will help counter risk aversion and strike a better balance between protecting children from genuine threats and giving them rich, challenging opportunities through which to learn and grow.</p><p></p><h2>The Midwich Cuckoos</h2><p>The quiet town of Midwich becomes the setting for horror when children are born who can control human minds</p><p><b>John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beyon Harris</b> had a variety of careers before becoming an author, but decided to take up writing professionally in 1925.

Since c.1730, most English manufacturers have produced miniatures of their full-sized wares, yet while countless words have been written about pottery and porcelain, mention of miniatures has been restricted to a chapter in one or two books, and a few magazine articles. Even the best books on English ceramics do scant justice to this minor but understandably popular aspect of collecting. Here, at last, is a comprehensive and definitive work on small items, too large for the &#39;dolls&#39; house, mostly too small for ordinary use. These include teasets and dinner sets, children&#39;s plates, cradles, ewers and basins, jugs, mugs, jelly moulds, taper candlesticks and a few decorative items.

The benefits are felt when people speak, sing, hum, chant, as Laurel Elizabeth Keyes explained in her groundbreaking book <i>Toning</i> over 30 years ago. The specific act of toning creates vocal sounds and vibrational patterns that influence health and well-being. <i>Toning, the Healing and Creative Power of the Voice</i> contains the results and observations that Laurel Keyes experienced while experimenting in her own body as well as in others. <br>One person who applied the life-changing healing technique is Don Campbell, best-selling author of <i>The Mozart Effect</i>, who credits much of his success to the tools he acquired from <i>Toning</i>.</p><p>Laurel Elizabeth Keyes was a teacher and author in Denver, Colorado.

These memoirs, recently discovered in the archive of Fr. Bruan&#x2019;s Assumptionist order by Soviet scholar Gary Hamburg, offer an intimate account of Fr. Braun&#x2019;s valiant effort to uphold Christian worship in the only Catholic church allowed to operate in Stalin&#x2019;s Moscow.<br>Posted to Moscow in 1934 as chaplain of the United States embassy, Father Braun served the embassy staff and local parishioners in the Saint Louis des Fran�ais Church at a moment when Stalin&#x2019;s anti-religious campaign was reaching a crescendo. He describes the Soviet government&#x2019;s intimidation and arrest of his parishioners, police surveillance of the church building, and personal harassment designed to force him out of the country. Father Braun&#x2019;s responses to these pressures&#x2015;sometimes amusing, sometimes heart-rending, but always intelligent and soulful&#x2015;tell us much about the capacity of ordinary people to respond to extraordinary circumstances. Under his pen, Soviet society comes alive, with its citizens&#x2019; poverty, cynicism, humor, and courage on full display.<br>Accompanying the memoirs is an introductory, historical essay by G. M. Hamburg. <i>In Lubianka&#x2019;s Shadow</i> is required reading for anyone interested in modern Russian history and for those concerned about the survival of religious faith under political assault.</p><p>"This is an astonishing memoir: astonishing for the story it tells of the ordeal of an American priest in sustaining the only Catholic church in Moscow during the terrible years of the Great Terror and World War II; astonishing for its account of 'Soviet reality' in those years, perhaps unparalleled in range and depth among foreigners' memoirs of this period; and astonishing for the author's unsuccessful attempts to get his Moscow memoir published during his lifetime, as recounted in Gary Hamburg's expert introduction." --Terence Emmons, Professor Emeritus of Russian History, Stanford University <p>"This memoir is one of the most remarkable historical documents to come to light in an era of major archival revelations in Soviet history. Because of the unique nature of the circumstances of Father Braun's tenure in Moscow, his memoir reveals a previously unilluminated side of Soviet existence. Father Braun's personal commitment and courage enabled him to achieve a familiarity with Soviet society and officialdom that leads to incidents, by turns, movingly affirmative of human capacity for nobility and selflessness, chillingly reminiscent of the worst sides of human nature, amusing in a Kafka-esque fashion, and breathtaking from an historian's perspective for the internality and intimacy they reveal." --Thomas Sanders, United States Naval Academy</p>&#34;Father Braun&#39;s memoir is a remarkable document, a compelling testimony to faith and personal courage. At the same time these recollections present a unique window through which to view life in Russia during that country&#39;s most difficult times--the Stalinist terror and the Great Patriotic War.&#34; --Richard G.

This is a study not only of an influential man and the bank he operated in Philadelphia but also of the growing interdependence between the institutions of government and finance in early nineteenth-century America.</p><p>In a period when precedents were being set in a new nation and large corporations were beginning to predominate in the business of banking, Girard, a man of undisputed business acumen, established in Philadelphia what was to become the largest private bank of its time and as such a monument to free enterprise. At the same time, along with Astor and other influential financiers, Girard was instrumental in financing the War of 1812 and in establishing the second Bank of the United States. His close association with the Madison administration and the Treasury Department made him a key figure in the evolving relationship between the federal government and the financial community.</p><p>Applying modern statistical techniques to the comprehensive records of the old Girard Bank, Donald Adams has uncovered a great deal of information, hitherto largely unavailable to scholars, about banking practices in early America. In this book he analyzes day-to-day operations&#x2014;the kinds of loans that were typical, the devices for maintaining liquidity, the organization of staff&#x2014;as well as long-run investment decisions and their impact on the formation of American finance.</p><p>While other studies have been made of the anatomy and influence of early chartered and corporate banks, Adams' is the first history of America's largest private bank. It provides a rare glimpse of the inner structure and strategy of an important financial institution and of the entrepreneurial and political activities of its founder.</p></p><p>Donald R.

He then jumps on his trampoline until it's time for a familiar bedtime routine of using the potty and brushing his teeth (with help from his human sister, Lady) before hearing a bedtime story and being tucked into his cuddle pod by Robo-Mom and Robo-Dad. This robot-loving toddler is then asked to power down his various body parts. The images are satisfactory, but simple pictures of a happy boy in robot pajamas are ill matched to wording such as, "Ro-Buddy makes a laser-beam pee-pee. He cleans his metallic hands with super-sensitive germ-blaster wipes." This book also disappoints with its mundane text. Parents seeking options to guide children in powering down will do better choosing Andrew Daddo's Goodnight, Me or Barbara Bottner's Feet, Go to Sleep.

The economy has tanked, but they do have a client, the owners of a posh B&amp;B in a historic home in St. Augustine, Florida. They want to put in a swimming pool and ask Faye and Joe to look for important artifacts on the site. When an employee of the B&amp;B disappears, leaving traces of blood in her car and a note along with some priceless artifacts for Faye, everyone fears the worst.

True to Pentecostal theology, the Jimmy Swaggart Commentary collection leads its readers chapter by chapter to a better understanding of the Bible. Rather than providing notes on every Bible verse, these commentaries focus on the salient verses of each chapter to offer the reader a condensed synopsis of what the Holy Spirit intended. Where most relevant, cultural and historical references are also included, along with explanations of the allegories, types, and symbolisms used in the Bible to add depth and dimension for students of the Holy Scriptures. Yet, what seems to separate this work from all other commentaries are the biblical applications made to present day circumstances facing every believer. Printed on high-quality paper and bound with a beautiful hardback cover, this unique reference will be cherished by anyone who loves to study the Word of God.</p><p></p><h2>Sydney Harbour</h2><p><p>Ambitious and wide-ranging, this sweeping history of one of the world&#x2019;s most recognized landmarks&nbsp;explores every aspect of Sydney Harbor&nbsp;through studies of its natural, human, and cultural history.

He tested the adhesion of his thick-soled boots, adjusted a strap and found them excellent. He flexed his shoulders within their padding -- the armor was slightly stiff with newness; he would have to allow for that. </p><p> Vrenn's Lance still hung on its charge rack. He leaned into the wall cabinet, read full charge on the indicator, and carefully lifted the weapon out. The Lance was a cylinder of metal and crystal, as thick as his palm was wide. He rested its blank metal, Null end on the floor, and the glass Active tip just reached his shoulder. Then he hefted it, spun it, ran his fingers over the controls in the checkout sequence, watching flashes and listening to answering clicks. The crystal tip glowed blue with neutral charge. </p><p> It was a fine Lance, absolutely new like his armor. Vrenn had never before had anything that was new. He wondered what would happen to these things, after they had won the game...if there would be prizes to the victors. He took a deep breath of the prep room's air, which was warm and deliciously moist; he lifted his Lance to shoulder-ready and turned around. </p><p> Across the room, Dezhe and Rokis were helping each other into Flier rigs, shiny metal harnesses and glossy boots with spurs. Rokis tightened her left hand inside the control gauntlet, and rose very rapidly, almost banging her green helmet on the dim ceiling. Dezhe snorted, grabbed one of Rokis's spurs and pretended to pull her back down. </p><p> <i>"G'daya</i> new stuff." That was Ragga, who was struggling his immense bulk into the even greater bulk of a Blockader's studded hide armor. "Not a <i>g'dayt</i> crease in it, can't <i>khest'n</i> move." He did a few squats-and-stretches, looked a little more satisfied, but not much. </p><p> "Who said you could move anyway?" Gelly said. Ragga swiped at her; she danced out of the way without the slightest difficulty. "You'd better not move. You might fall down, and I don't think the rest of us together could get you up again." </p><p> Ragga showed his teeth and arched his arms, roared like a stormwalker. Gelly skittered away, laughing. Ragga was laughing too, a sound not much different from his roar. </p><p> Gelly sealed up the front of her uniform, a coverall of shiny green mesh, with gloves and boots of finely jointed metal on her slender hands and feet. She was the best Swift of their House: the House Proctors said she might be the best Swift of all the Houses. </p><p> Others said other things, about her slimness, her smooth forehead, the lightness of her bones and flesh. Vrenn felt a little sorry for her: when they were younger, he had called her "Ugly, ugly!" with the others. But she couldn't help being ugly, and if it was true that some of her genes were Vulcan or Romulan -- or even Human! -- that was not her fault either. He did not think she was part-Human, though. Vrenn had killed a Human in the Year Games, when he was six, his first intelligent kill, and Humans were slow, not swift. </p><p> There had been the one who called Gelly <i>kuveleta:</i> servitor's half-child. Zharn had killed that one, and done it well. They had all killed, Zharn and Vrenn and Ragga many different races, but Zharn was the best. </p><p> But they were all the best, Vrenn thought. Their positions had not been randomly chosen, nor they themselves: of the three hundred residents of House Twenty-Four, they were the nine best at <i>klin zha kinta,</i> the game with live pieces. </p><p> Now Zharn was sitting against the wall of the prep room, in full Fencer's armor: smooth green plates and helmet, slender metal staff across his knees. He was humming "Undefeated," a favorite song of House <i>Gensa.</i> Segon, a lightly armored Vanguard, was near him, keeping time with his bootheel. A little farther away, Graade and Voloh, the other Vanguards, held hands and kept harmony. </p><p> Zharn began to sing aloud, and in a moment they were all singing. </p><p> <i>And though the cold brittles the flesh,<br> The chain of duty cannot be broken,<br> For the chain is forged in the heart's own fire<br> Which cold cannot extinguish...</i> </p><p> The door opened. In the long corridor beyond, lit greenly by small lamps on the walls, was their Senior Proctor, old Khidri tai-Gensa. Khidri was nearly forty years old, very wrinkled; he had been a full Commander in the Navy until vacuum crippled his lungs. Next to him was a Naval officer, in black tunic and gold dress sash and Commander's insignia, with medals for ships taken. </p><p> Zharn was instantly on his feet. "Green Team, present!" </p><p> The players snapped to attention at once, wrists crossed in salute, weapons at ready-arms. </p><p> Khidri gave them a slight smile and one short nod. "This is a high day for the House <i>Gensa,"</i> he said. "We are chosen to play at the command of Thought Admiral Kethas epetai-Khemara." </p><p> Vrenn felt his chest tighten, but he did not move. None of the Team did. A planner for the entire Navy! he thought, and knew then that he was right: they were the very best...and others knew it. </p><p> Khidri said, "The Thought Admiral is of course a Grand Master of <i>klin zha</i>...this day we must be worthy of a Grand Master's play." In the last was the smallest hint of a threat, or perhaps a warning. Next to Khidri, the Navy officer stood impassive and rather grim. </p><p> "Zharn Gensa, is your Green Team ready?" </p><p> "Armed and prepared, Proctor Khidri." </p><p> "Then bring them," Khidri said, and as he turned around Vrenn thought he saw the Proctor's smile widen. Then Vrenn looked at Zharn. The Fencer was nine, a year older than the rest of them, and seemed the pure image of leadership. </p><p> "House Twenty-Four Green Team," Zharn said, "onward to the victory!" </p><p> The <i>klin zha</i> players filed out of the room, marching in step down the green corridor, singing. </p><p> <i>Yet if my line should die,<br> It dies with its teeth in the enemy's throat,<br> It dies with its name on the enemy's tongue.<br> For just as mere life is not victory,<br> Mere death is not defeat;<br> And in the next world I shall kill the foe a thousand times,<br> Laughing,<br> Undefeated.</i> </p><p> The Arena Gallery was a long, low-ceilinged room, furnished with large soft cushions and small wooden tables with trays of succulents. Servitors, moving silently in clean tan gowns of restrictive cut, replaced the trays when they became empty or messy. Fog hung at the ceiling, humidifier mist mixed with the personal incenses some of the officers present carried. One long wall of the room was entirely of dark glass. </p><p> There were slightly more than a dozen of high ranks present, Naval and Marine, and two civilian administrators with a reputation at <i>klin zha.</i> Also in the room were a few of the officers' consorts -- two for Admiral Kezhke, who was never moderate -- and three Vulcans, all <i>tharavul.</i> </p><p> "The spindles for first move, Thought Admiral?" General Margon sutai-Demma held out a pair of hexagonal rods, of polished white bone with numerals inlaid in gold on their faces. Margon gave them a small, rattling toss and caught them again. They showed double sixes. There was a mildly unpleasant look on Margon's face, but there usually was, and the scar at the side of his mouth only added to it. </p><p> Behind Margon, Force Leader Mabli vestai-Galann sat on a cushion, looking quite uncomfortable. One of Margon's <i>kuve</i> consorts was stroking Mabli's shoulders, which did not seem to relax him at all, though the female's claws were fully retracted. Mabli kept glancing at the other officers: every one outranked him. Worse, the administrators did as well. Mabli looked straight at his opponent. </p><p> Thought Admiral Kethas epetai-Khemara had deep wrinkles in his knobbed forehead, hair very white at his temples. He was fifty-two years old, an age at which Klingons of the Imperial Race should be dead by</p></p><h2>The Harmony Guide To Crocheting: Techniques and Stitches</h2><p>Sure to appeal to both novice and experienced needleworkers, this comprehensive pattern library contains more than 500 crochet stitches, each one accompanied by complete instructions, an illustrative diagram, and a full-color photograph. <b>Full-color photographs.</b></p><p></p><h2>Ismail Merchant&#39;s Passionate Meals: The New Indian Cuisine for Fearless Cooks and Adventurous Eaters</h2><p>In his second cookbook, a successful motion picture producer offers a selection of delicious easy-to-prepare dishes, both traditional and non-traditional, from his native India, including chutneys, salads, appetizers, fish, poultry, and desserts.</p><p><p>Ismail Merchant is one of Hollywood's premier movie producers with more than forty films and four Oscar nominations to his name.

We toil alone for months on end, then, once a year, we emerge from our dens to publish a book. It can be a daunting experience, especially for someone like me, who is not gregarious and outgoing by nature. But there is one aspect of promotion I truly love: meeting my readers and answering their questions. During each stop on my book tour, I reserve the bulk of my time for a lively conversation with the audience. I learn much from these encounters-indeed, some of the comments are so insightful they take my breath away. There is one question I am asked each night without fail, and it remains my favorite: "How in the world did you ever think of Gabriel Allon?" The answer is complicated. In one sense, he was the result of a long, character-construction process. In another, he was a bolt from the blue. I'll try to explain. </p> <p> In 1999, after publishing <i>The Marching Season</i>, the second book in the Michael Osbourne series, I decided it was time for a change. We were nearing the end of the Clinton administration, and the president was about to embark on a last-ditch effort to bring peace to the Middle East. I had the broad outlines of a story in mind: a retired Israeli assassin is summoned from retirement to track down a Palestinian terrorist bent on destroying the Oslo peace process. I thought long and hard before giving the Israeli a name. I wanted it to be biblical, like my own, and to be heavy with symbolism. I finally decided to name him after the archangel Gabriel. As for his family name, I chose something short and simple: Allon, which means "oak tree" in Hebrew. I liked the image it conveyed. Gabriel Allon: God's angel of vengeance, solid as an oak. </p> <p> Gabriel's professional r�sum�-the operations he had carried out-came quickly. But what about his other side? What did he like to do in his spare time? What was his cover? I knew I wanted something distinct. Something memorable. Something that would, in many respects, be the dominant attribute of his character. I spent many frustrating days mulling over and rejecting possibilities. Then, while walking along one of Georgetown's famous redbrick sidewalks, my wife, Jamie, reminded me that we had a dinner date that evening at the home of David Bull, a man regarded as one of the finest art restorers in the world. I stopped dead in my tracks and raised my hands toward the heavens. Gabriel Allon was complete. He was going to be an art restorer, and a very good one at that. </p> <p> Over my objections, the book was entitled <i>The Kill Artist</i> and it would go on to become a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. It was not, however, supposed to be the first book in a long-running series. But once again, fate intervened. In 2000, after moving to G.P. Putnam &amp; Sons, my new publishers asked me what I was working on. When I mumbled something about having whittled it down to two or three options, they offered their first piece of advice. They really didn't care what it was about, they just wanted one thing: Gabriel Allon. </p> <p> I then spent the next several minutes listing all the reasons why Gabriel, now regarded as one of the most compelling and successful continuing characters in the mystery-thriller genre, should never appear in a second book. I had conceived him as a "one off" character, meaning he would be featured in one story and then ride into the sunset. I also thought he was too melancholy and withdrawn to build a series around, and, at nearly fifty years of age, perhaps a bit too old as well. My biggest concern, however, had to do with his nationality and religion. I thought there was far too much opposition to Israel in the world-and far too much raw anti-Semitism-for an Israeli continuing character ever to be successful in the long term. </p> <p> My new publishers thought otherwise, and told me so. Because Gabriel lived in Europe and could pass as German or Italian, they believed he came across as more "international" than Israeli. But what they really liked was Gabriel's other job: art restoration. They found the two opposing sides of his character-destroyer and healer-fascinating. What's more, they believed he would stand alone on the literary landscape. There were lots of CIA officers running around saving the world, they argued, but no former Israeli assassins who spent their spare time restoring Bellini altarpieces. </p> <p> The more they talked, the more I could see their point. I told them I had an idea for a story involving Nazi art looting during the Second World War and the scandalous activities of Swiss banks. "Write it with Gabriel Allon," they said, "and we promise it will be your biggest-selling book yet." Eventually, the book would be called <i>The English Assassin</i>, and, just as Putnam predicted, it sold twice as many copies as its predecessor. Oddly enough, when it came time to write the next book, I still wasn't convinced it should be another Gabriel novel. Though it seems difficult to imagine now, I actually conceived the plot of <i>The Confessor</i> without him in mind. Fortunately, my editor, Neil Nyren, saved me from myself. The book landed at #5 on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list and received some of the warmest reviews of my career. After that, a series was truly born. </p> <p> I am often asked whether it is necessary to read the novels in sequence. The answer is no, but it probably doesn't hurt, either. For the record, the order of publication is <i>The Kill Artist</i>, <i>The English Assassin</i>, <i>The Confessor</i>, <i>A Death in Vienna</i>, <i> Prince of Fire</i>, <i> The Messenger</i>, <i>The Secret Servant</i>, and <i>Moscow Rules</i>, my first #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. <i>The Defector</i> pits Gabriel in a final, dramatic confrontation with the Russian oligarch and arms dealer Ivan Kharkov, and I have been told it far surpasses anything that has come before it in the series. And to think that, if I'd had my way, only one Gabriel Allon book would have been written. I remain convinced, however, that had I set out in the beginning to create him as a continuing character, I would surely have failed. I have always believed in the power of serendipity. Art, like life, rarely goes according to plan. Gabriel Allon is proof of that. </p><strong>The death of a journalist leads Israeli spy Gabriel Allon to Russia, where he finds that, in terms of spycraft, even he has something to learn in this #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller.</strong><br><br>Moscow is no longer the gray, grim city of Soviet times.

Facsimile Edition. &#34;The basis for the text and dust jacket is a numbered copy owned by the First Edition Lilbrary.&#34; ISSUE POINTS: &#34;The first printing of Ulysses (publication date February 2, 1922) is among the rarest and most sought after first editions of the twentieth century. Shakespeare and Company published one thousand numbered copies of Joyce&#39;s masterpiece for subscribers in three distinct formats. The first hundred books were printed on Holland paper, signed by Joyce and sold for 350 francs each. The next 150 copies were printed on verge d&#39; arches and sold for 250 francs each. Copies numbered 251 to 1,000 were printed on linen paper with a laid finish and sold for 150 francs. All of these books are considered first editions. The text has numerous errors which were noted and corrected in later editions. Sheets that were printed in France were later published in England by the Egoist Press once the limited Shakespeare and Company edition had sold out.&#34; This is an exact facsimile of the 1922 first edition published by Shakespeare and Company in Paris, in printed wraps and enclosed in a tan-cloth clamshell box, with title and date spine patches. Note that Ulysses is one of three books published by The First Edition Library by subscription only in a separate series &#34;Published in Paris in Paperback&#34;. The other two titles are Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov and Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Book is in new condition (slipcased book is in publisher&#39;s shrinkwrap).</p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.<p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p><p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The 1934 text, as corrected and reset in 1961. Ulysses is one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. It was not easy to find a publisher in America willing to take it on, and when Jane Jeap and Margaret Anderson started printing extracts from the book their literary magazine The Little Review in 1918, they were arrested and charged with publishing obscenity. They were fined $100, and even The New York Times expressed satisfaction with their conviction. Ulysses was not published in book form until 1922, when another American woman, Sylvia Beach, published it in Paris for her Shakespeare &amp; Company. Ulysses was not available legally in any English-speaking country until 1934, when Random House successfully defended Joyce against obscenity charges and published it in the Modern Library. This edition follows the complete and unabridged text as corrected and reset in 1961. Judge John Woolsey's decision lifting the ban against Ulysses is reprinted, along with a letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of Random House, and the original foreword to the book by Morris L. Ernst, who defended Ulysses during the trial.</p><h2>False God of Rome (3) (Vespasian)</h2><p><p><b>Vespasian's mission will lead to violence, mayhem, and theft&#x2014;and in the end, to a betrayal so great it will echo through the ages</b></p><p>Vespasian is serving as a military officer on the outskirts of the Roman Empire, suppressing local troubles and defending the Roman way. But political events in Rome&#x2014;Tiberius's increasingly insane debauchery, the escalating grain crisis&#x2014;draw him back to the city. When Caligula becomes Emperor, Vespasian believes that things will improve. Instead, he watches the young emperor deteriorate from Rome's shining star to a blood-crazed, incestuous, all-powerful madman. Lavish building projects, endless games, public displays of his relationship with his sister, Drusilla, and a terrified senate are as nothing to Caligula's most ambitious plan: to bridge the bay of Neapolis and ride over it wearing Alexander's breastplate.

During World War II, he was shot down in a B-17 over Belgium. With the help of the French Resistance, he made his way through Occupied France and back to his base in England. Ordinary citizens hid him in their homes, fed him, disguised him, sheltered him from the Germans. Many families willingly hid Allied aviators, knowing the risks--they would have been shot or sent to a concentration camp if they were discovered by the Germans.</p> <p>In 1987 the town in Belgium honored the crew by erecting a memorial at the crash site, where one of the ten crew members died. The surviving crew were invited for three days of festivities, including a flyover by the Belgian Air Force. Over three thousand Allied airmen were rescued during the war, and an extraordinary, deep bond between them and their European helpers endures even now.</p> <p>My father-in-law, Barney Rawlings, spent a couple of months hiding out in France in 1944, frantically memorizing a few French words to pass himself off as a Frenchman, but his ordeal had not inspired in me any fiction until I started taking a French class. Suddenly, the language was transporting me back in time and across the ocean, as I tried to imagine a tall, out-of-place American struggling to say Bonjour. Barney had a vague memory of a girl who had escorted him in Paris in 1944. He remembered that her signal was something blue--a scarf, maybe, or a beret. The notion of a girl in a blue beret seized me, and I was off.</p> <p>I had my title, but I didn't know what my story would be. I had to go to France to imagine the country in wartime. What would I have done in such circumstances of fear, deprivation, and uncertainty? What if my pilot character returns decades later to search for the people who had helped him escape?</p> <p>Writing a novel about World War II and the French Resistance was a challenge, both sobering and thrilling. I read many riveting escape-and-evasion accounts of airmen and the Resistance networks organized to hide them and then send them on grueling treks across the Pyrenees to safety. But it was the people I met in France and Belgium who made the period come alive for me. They had lived it.</p> <p>In Belgium, I was entertained lavishly by the people who had honored the B-17 crew with the memorial, including some locals who had witnessed the crash-landing. I was overwhelmed by their generosity. They welcomed me with an extravagant three-cheek kiss, but one 90-year-old man, Fernand Fontesse, who had been in the Resistance and had been a POW, planted his kiss squarely on my lips.</p> <p>In a small town north of Paris I met Jean Hallade. He had been only fifteen when 2nd Lt. Rawlings was hidden in a nearby house. Jean took a picture of Barney in a French beret, a photo to be used for the fake ID card he would need as he traveled through France disguised as a French cabinetmaker over the next few months.</p> <p>And in Paris I became friends with lovely, indomitable Mich�le Agniel, who had been a girl guide in the Resistance. Her family aided fifty Allied aviators, including Barney Rawlings. She takes her scrapbooks from the war years to the schools to show children what once happened. "This happened here," she says. "Here is a ration card. This is a swastika." She pauses. "Never again," she says.</p> <p>The characters in <i>The Girl in the Blue Beret</i> are not portraits of actual people, but the situations were inspired by very real individuals whom I regard as heroes.</p><b>Bobbie Ann Mason</b> is the author of <i>In Country</i>, <i>Shiloh and Other Stories</i>, <i>An Atomic Romance</i>, <i>Nancy Culpepper</i>, and a memoir, <i>Clear Springs</i>.

Influenced by the philosophy of Henri Bergson, Deleuze here offers a compelling analysis of the cinematic treatment of time and memory, thought and speech. The work draws on examples from major film makers, including Federico Fellini, Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles, among many others.</p><p>Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was one of the key figures in poststructuralism, and one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. His major works include, with Felix Guattari, <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i> and <i>Anti-Oedipus</i>.&#34;Cinema I and Cinema II must be understood as works of philosophy, not of film criticism. They are Deleuze&#39;s reflection on the new ways the cinema enables us to think about time and movement, opening up insights into semiotics and our ideological construction of a world increasingly experienced through representational media.... The main purpose of these books is to identify and explore the implications of a vital shift from classical, pre-World War II cinema of the movement-image to post-World War II cinema of the time-imaging.... &#34;Cinema 1 and Cinema 2 perhaps ultimately have more to teach us about philosophy, conceptions of subjectivity, and hermeneutics than to say something about any specific film. These books are challenging because they develop their own vocabulary in dialogue with the history of philosophy, and they assume a wide knowledge of films from the Soviet, European and Hollywood traditions. They reward the effort required to read them, however, for the original tools with which they provide us to understand cinema and semiotics more generally. Deleuze concludes that it is important to think of cinema not as a language, but as a way of bringing to light &#39;intelligible content&#39; which is a condition through which language constructs its objects (Cinema 2, p.251). Thus, purely optical and sound images which do not extend into action might be one way in which aesthetics might help us break outside of the determining structure of linguistic systems, enabling us to imagine the world otherwise. Deleuze helps us to see cinema as more than just a collection of texts but as additionally &#39;a new practice of images and signs, whose theory philosophy must produce as conceptual practice&#39; (Cinema 2, p. 269).&#34;- Sherryl Vint, Film International, Issue 27 -- Film International</p><h2>I Say Me for a Parable: The Oral Autobiography of Mance Lipscomb, Texas Bluesman</h2><p>An account of the life of the legendary bluesman describes how this son of a slave supported his family by tenant farming cotton and who perfected his art as a blues musician and songwriter at countless dances.</p><p>There has in recent years been an explosion of interest in blues music and its brilliant creators. No other form of music is more deeply rooted in the realities of American life or more expressive of its joys and sorrows. Mance Lipscomb (1895-1976), the son of a former slave, lived almost his whole life in Navasota, Texas, supporting himself and his family by tenant farming cotton, plowing, and picking &#34;from caint ta caint&#34; (can&#39;t see to can&#39;t see) for a meager return. But he was also a superb &#34;gittah&#34; player, singer, and songwriter who played the blues at countless &#34;Satiddy Night Suppas&#34;, where rural blacks celebrated the end of the hard workweek and blew off steam. Theirs was a life beset with racism and brutality, but redeemed by an indomitable spirit and a resilient sense of humor, of which Mance&#39;s was a sterling example. In 1960 Mance Lipscomb was &#34;discovered&#34; by Chris Strachwitz of Arhoolie Records, who taped his songs in his own home and issued a record. This led to a debut appearance before 41,000 people at the Berkeley Folk Festival in 1961 - and instant musical celebrity. Mance traveled all over the country playing his music and influencing such musicians as Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Ry Cooder, and Taj Mahal. But he always remained rooted in the life of Navasota. &#34;I say me for a parable&#34; means, roughly, &#34;I use myself as an example&#34;. In this book Mance tells his own story in his own authentic language, as a representative of a hard yet rich way of rural African-American life and as a creator and purveyor of a music that has conquered the globe. Of special note are the &#34;go-alongs&#34; (or chapters) that relate Mance&#39;s adventures with the legendary Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, who ridNavasota of its virulent violence against blacks before he went on to capture Bonnie and Clyde, and that tell of his times in &#34;this music bizness&#34;, including a command performance for Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow on their yacht. I Say Me for a Parable is a major document in Southern folk-lore, a monument to a vanished way of life, a touching extended self-portrait by a world-class storyteller and word spinner, and probably the most authentic account of the real roots of the blues ever put to paper. What All God&#39;s Dangers is to sharecropping, I Say Me for a Parable is for country blues.The oral autobiography of black East Texas farmer and songster Mance Lipscomb--a life that's one of the great American stories. Lipscomb (1895-1976) knew how to tell a tale, and had incredible tales to tell--about race and genealogy; about his allegiance to his part-Choctaw mother; about epic beatings by his father (who could play a cigar-box fiddle like a heavenly harp). The musician also speaks here about having his best friend, a cousin, and many acquaintances murdered by whites; about Frank Hamer, the Texas lawman who killed Bonnie and Clyde and who made Lipscomb his assistant and confidant when Lipscomb was ten years old; about farming (there's a dramatic account of share croppers readying mules to plow in the 4:00 a.m. darkness); about causing mass catharsis among 41,000 listeners when he played ``Motherless Children'' in Berkeley--ending his first-ever concert after just three songs. Lipscomb also demonstrates impressive insight into the structure of, and influences on, his musical style. But it was a mistake for editor-transcriber Alyn to begin with talk about Lipscomb's religious philosophy rather than to let that philosophy unobtrusively inform the narrative throughout. Moreover, Alyn's attempt to preserve Lipscomb's colorful speech through nonstandard spellings seems to trivialize his subject, and sometimes confuses (for instance, when ``rail'' is written for ``real,'' or ``miny'' for ``many''). Still, gratitude is owed Alyn for preserving Lipscomb's remarkable story. (Photos) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Copeland was born in 1949 in Syria, where his Alabama-born father was the CIA station chief in Damascus and his Scottish ex-spy mother a noted archeologist. Growing up in Cairo, Beirut and London, he rebelled against his largely absent father (who helped orchestrate coups that brought Egypt's Gamal Adbel Nasser and Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power) and against an insular world of privilege. He joined a motorcycle gang, ran away from home and returned. In 1967, he joined the U.S. Army. A sergeant at 19, he tripped once on LSD while fighting the Vietcong. Moving to the U.S. in 1970, he became a hippie and joined antiwar protests with other Vietnam veterans. Influenced by his younger brother Stewart, a songwriter/drummer/agent who formed The Police with Sting, and older brother Miles, owner of IRS Records, Copeland eventually formed his own agency, Frontier Booking International (FBI), signing on tour a stellar array of clients that included R.E.M., Joan Jett, The Police, XTC, the B-52s, the Ramones, the Cure, the Sex Pistols and the Go-Go's, among other bands. Copeland helped launch reggae by booking UB40, Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru, and he signed on Christian rockers such as Amy Grant. Offering a front-row seat to the birth of new wave and punk, his savvy, deadpan narrative is also a moving record of self-discovery. Author tour. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.The author, a well-known booking agent for rock acts, presents an engaging memoir. Born in Syria amid a coup engineered by his father, a CIA agent, Copeland recounts his exotic childhood in the Middle East and his rebellious teens. After a decorated stint in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, he became a struggling booking agent in England and the United States. In the last half of the book, the author recounts his steady rise as a punk/new wave/reggae agent, detailing his initial major success with the first U.S. tour of the Police, which included his brother, Stewart, on drums and which was managed by his brother, Miles, who later founded I.R.S. Records; his work with such groups as R.E.M., the Go-Gos, and the Ramones; and the establishment of his Frontier Booking International. In addition to providing an interesting perspective on rock'n'roll, Copeland offers a compelling account of his colorful life at midpoint.

Now, nearly twenty years later, in a sequel that is more hopeful than despairing &#x2015; more attuned to possibilities than to problems &#x2015; Noll updates his assessment and charts a positive way forward for evangelical scholarship.<br><br> Noll shows how the orthodox Christology confessed in the classic Christian creeds provides an ideal vantage point for viewing the vast domains of human learning and can enhance intellectual engagement in a variety of specific disciplines. In a substantial postscript he candidly addresses the question <i>How fares the &#x201c;evangelical mind&#x201d; today?</i></p><p>Mark A. Noll is Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame."One of America's finest historians, Mark Noll takes us inside his mind to see the set of Christian convictions that have shaped his work.

We are in his debt for this considerable service."<br> &#x2015; David F. Wells<br> Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary<br><br> "It is odd that so much modern theology has treated Christology as just another doctrinal topic. Mark Noll shows us Jesus right where St. Paul left him &#x2015; in Colossians &#x2015; as the one 'in whom all things hold together.' Now that we have a christological clarion call for scholarship of all kinds, it's hard to believe we had none before. This is the ideal bookend for Noll's <i>Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</i>, sketching out a way for intellectual pilgrims to follow Jesus into academic fields of all kinds. May many take up that way."<br> &#x2015; Jason Byassee<br> Duke Divinity School<br><br> "Mark Noll resolves the <i>Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</i> with the scandal of Christ crucified."<br> &#x2015; Gene Edward Veith<br> Patrick Henry College<br><br> "In this wise and eloquent book Mark Noll draws on four decades of experience serving Christ in the academy. Many evangelical colleges and universities claim to be Christ-centered, but Noll shows the depth of meaning that phrase can convey. He offers a rich theological base for a life of learning, rooted in 'all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge' that are in Jesus Christ."<br> &#x2015; Joel Carpenter<br> Nagel Institute, Calvin College<br><br> "More than a sequel to his <i>Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</i>, Mark Noll's thoughtful new book offers at least the beginnings of a constructive christocentric theology for evangelical intellectual life. Rooted in the classic Christian creeds, Noll shows how a thoroughgoing Christocentrism can and should shape Christian engagement with such arenas as history, science, and biblical studies. . . . Though modest in length, this may be one of Noll's most important scholarly contributions."<br> &#x2015; David P. Gushee<br> Mercer University<br><br> "Without retreating from his principles, Noll in this book offers a mature, nuanced, and wide-ranging reprise of his <i>Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</i> &#x2015; but that is not all. By drawing constructively on poets, theologians, philosophers &#x2015; and especially on the great historic creeds and confessions of the faith &#x2015; he has crafted a challenging, inspiring christological philosophy of Christian education for the twenty-first century.

He began attracting attention with primarily female followers as author and publisher of the highly successful provocative books: &#34;&#34;Never Satisfied: How and Why Men Cheat&#34;&#34;, &#34;&#34;Men Cry in the Dark&#34;&#34;, &#34;&#34;The Maintenance Man&#34;&#34;, and lastly &#34;&#34;God&#39;s Gift to Women&#34;&#34;. Two of his titles ultimately were adapted into stage plays. Later, Baisden founded the Michael Baisden Foundation focusing on education, literacy and technology. Michael believes that books change lives and he is living proof! Michael continues to entertain, enlighten and educate as he pursues one of his first dreams, to have his novels adapted to major Motion pictures. The other dream was to host a Late Night Talk show. He got that chance in the fall of 2007, when he partnered with TV One to host and co-executive produce &#34;&#34;Baisden After Dark,&#34;&#34; featuring comedian George Willborn and band leader Morris Day.

In <i>The Amazing Book of Mazes</i>, award-winning maze designer Adrian Fisher presents over 350 photographs of more than 150 contemporary and historical maze designs, each one fully three-dimensional and interactive. In accompanying text, Fisher explains the complexities, innovations, and symbolism of each maze. Arranged by type, and including vertical, horizontal, and even mirror mazes, these mazes don&#x2019;t all invite solution, but they do test the limits of one&#x2019;s imagination. And with mazes enjoying a resurgence in popularity, the timing couldn&#x2019;t be better for this beguiling, comprehensive history and celebration.</p><p>Adrian Fisher is the world&#x2019;s leading maze designer. He has designed over 400 mazes in 23 countries since 1979 and is the holder of a Guinness World Record for his design of Stewart&#x2019;s Gardenland maize maze in Dorset, the world&#x2019;s largest temporary crop maze. Fisher lives in Dorset, England.Maze master Fisher's comprehensive guide to the many aspects of mazes features a wealth of color photographs and detailed diagrams and a fact-packed text providing general history, theory and design principles, and descriptions and analyses of specific mazes. Working from the concept of the labyrinth as a 4,000-year-old archetype that symbolizes the demands of the spiritual path, Fisher presents examples of puzzle mazes ancient and more recent defined by a complex network of joining paths with dead ends, twisting, deceptive alleys, and an elusive goal, such as England's Hampton Court Palace. Sumptuous and mind-boggling are the numerous vertical mazes constructed of hedges--"the garden form of the art" during the Renaissance--as well as maize fields, masonry, inflatables, and panels. Contemplative, healing, and meditative are the two-dimensional, horizontal mazes constructed of turf and pavers. Complete with a glossary and listing of additional readings and resources, Fisher's maze book belongs in architectural and cultural phenomena collections. <i>Whitney Scott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As an inveterate anthologist who loves flowers and likes picking up a last-minute rose, I took it as an auspicious sign that the shop is called Anthology. It is a splendid name for a florist: &#x201c;anthology&#x201d; derives from the Greek words for &#x201c;flower&#x201d; and &#x201c;collection.&#x201d; The horticultural meaning preceded the literary sense, and editors of poetry books gathered &#x201c;flowers of verse&#x201d; long before a French revolutionist published his &#x201c;flowers of evil.&#x201d; It is good to have a daily reminder of this connection between poems and &#x201c;glowing violets,&#x201d; &#x201c;fair musk-rose blooms,&#x201d; and daffodils &#x201c;with the green world they live in,&#x201d; for the making of an anthology is only incidentally like the art of flower arrangement. In practice it can be a pretty fraught affair. If it is successful, the endeavor will generate discussion and debate, some of it heated, even pugnacious, and more appropriate to a fight club than to a quiet bower, where &#x201c;the mind, from pleasure less, / Withdraws into its happiness.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you want to start an argument, put together an anthology, especially one that claims to be comprehensive,&#x201d; a jazz reviewer notes. &#x201c;No matter how noble the intent, it invites disaffection. Make the subject area jazz, and you create a minefield of sensitive historical, political, social and musical issues. It&#x2019;s a treacherous endeavor&#x2014;as is reviewing it.&#x201d;1 The statement remains true if you substitute &#x201c;exclusive&#x201d; for &#x201c;comprehensive&#x201d; and &#x201c;poetry&#x201d; for &#x201c;jazz.&#x201d; On the other hand, it&#x2019;s a sure proof that you&#x2019;re doing your job if your anthology quickens argument and dispute. People like anthologies&#x2014;there&#x2019;s something for everyone. Practitioners like being in them, spectators like knowing who&#x2019;s in and who&#x2019;s out, critics like laying down the law, and malcontents like the occasion to air their grievances. As for the maker of poetry anthologies in particular, there is the gratification of reaching an educated readership for the elusive but vital art form whose death has so often been predicted. Something beyond nobility, something in defiance of disaffection and even treachery, is at work here. Pascal&#x2019;s aphorism has a special application to poetry and its devotees: the heart has its reasons that reason can only guess at.<br> <br>The Best American Poetry 2012 is the twenty-fifth volume in the series&#x2014;twenty-sixth if you count Harold Bloom&#x2019;s 1998 distillation, The Best of the Best American Poetry, 1988&#x2013;1997. The books have provided a template for similar annuals from other nations. On my desk as I write, I have the 2009 volume of The Best Canadian Poetry in English (ed. A. F. Moritz, series ed. Molly Peacock) and The Best Australian Poems 2011 (ed. John Tranter), each with its compelling new voices. The Best Irish Poetry 2010, ed. Matthew Sweeney, joins the famous (Seamus Heaney) and the emerging (Leanne O&#x2019;Sullivan) in the time-honored fashion. The Best New Zealand Poems, which got its start in 2001, explains on its home page that &#x201c;We have shamelessly modeled this online project on the successful US paperback anthology, The Best American Poetry. Each year we publish twenty-five poems from recent literary magazines and poetry collections, where possible including notes about and by the poet, as well as links to related publishing and literary websites. In this way we hope that readers will be able to follow up fresh discoveries. There are plenty to be made.&#x201d; Last year brought a welcome newcomer, The Best British Poetry 2011 (ed. Roddy Lumsden). Other than consisting of seventy rather than seventy-five poems, the venture employs the identical structure and even the same typeface and design as The Best American Poetry. If there is one assumption common to all these &#x201c;best of&#x201d; books, it is that poetry has managed to thrive in the face of all the technological changes that seem, on the surface at least, so hostile to the muse.<br> <br>Reporters are interested in trends, and you, cornered, may feel the impulse to invent one out of whole cloth just to please an interviewer. But I feel confident in my prediction that more and more arranged marriages will be taking place between poetry and video&#x2014;confident enough to call this development a trend. Tom Devaney&#x2019;s online ONandOnScreen is devoted to poets&#x2019; pairing their work with a video of their choice. The aim is a dialogue between &#x201c;moving words and moving images&#x201d; in the expectation that the &#x201c;essential strangeness&#x201d; of each medium will be enhanced. In 2011, The Best American Poetry partnered with Motionpoems, a Minneapolis-based poetry and video initiative founded by Todd Boss, himself a poet whose work has appeared in this series, and the animator Angella Kassube. Motionpoems commissioned video artists&#x2014;commercial and freelance animators, filmmakers, musicians, sound designers, and producers&#x2014;to make short films of poems chosen from The Best American Poetry 2011.2 Where the poets choose their visual accompaniment in Devaney&#x2019;s project, Motionpoems reverses the order. The animators pick the poems and take it from there. To this observer, the dozen Motionpoems screened in October 2011 vindicated the concept of such &#x201c;passive collaborations&#x201d; between poets and visual artists, passive only in the sense that the poet&#x2019;s job is done after writing the poem and the video-maker is on his or her own. The idea of basing a video on a poem may one day seem as natural and inevitable as the setting of poems to music used to be.<br> <br>While I am not sure that it constitutes a trend, exactly, I believe that the &#x201c;uncanny&#x201d; is a category too little invoked in discussions of American poetry. The poets of our time are drawn to ghostly demarcations, spectral presences. There are ghosts in the machine, ghosts in the martini, and they turn up regularly&#x2014;angelic or demonic, benevolent or cruel&#x2014;in poems. When, in late December, a senior editor at National Public Radio asked me to name three of my favorite poems of 2011 and to record some thoughts about them, I noticed only after assembling the trio that they share this quality of mystery and the uncanny, offering a spooky but also exhilarating glimpse of a spiritual world beyond our own. Mark Strand&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Mysterious Arrival of an Unusual Letter,&#x201d; a prose poem, owes something of its effect to its brevity; it contains all of ten sentences, most of them short. The poet tells us about arriving home one night after a grueling day at the office. On the table he sees an envelope with his name on it. &#x201c;The handwriting was my father&#x2019;s, but he had been dead for forty years. As one might, I began to think that maybe, just maybe, he was alive, living a secret life somewhere nearby. How else to explain the envelope? To steady myself, I sat down, opened it, and pulled out the letter. &#x2018;Dear Son,&#x2019; was the way it began. &#x2018;Dear Son&#x2019; and then nothing.&#x201d; The poem ends there, as eerie as a dream visitation from a deceased parent or lover.<br> <br>Like Strand&#x2019;s poem, Stephanie Brown&#x2019;s &#x201c;Notre Dame&#x201d; was chosen by Mark Doty for The Best American Poetry 2012. Though not in prose, Brown&#x2019;s lines approach plain speech, an unadorned directness, eschewing the glamour of rhyme or traditional form. Brown describes staying with her family in an apartment near the great cathedral in Paris. One morning she wakes up and apprehends &#x201c;two angels hovering&#x201d; to protect her younger son. Only when the poem ends do we get the full context of this vision or waking dream: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s sad to walk around the Seine when you are getting divorced while everyone else / Is kissing and filming their honeymoons or new loves. Even / My husband, after we got back together, laughed at that. / Because he, too, had been heartsick on another part of the planet.&#x201d;<br> <br>My third pick was Paul Violi&#x2019;s &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;ll Never Be Able to Finish That Poem to Bob&#x201d; in the Brooklyn-based literary magazine Hanging Loose.3 The poem is jolly and even madcap, featuring &#x201c;a man in a chicken suit / handing out flyers on Houston Street&#x201d; among other urban wonders. &#x201c;It would have been a long poem,&#x201d; the poem concludes, &#x201c;and it would have made a lot of sense / and shown why I believe Bob Hershon is a wise man.&#x201d; (Hershon edits Hanging Loose.) What makes the poem almost heartbreaking is the knowledge that Violi wrote it in the face of his own death. Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January 2011, this amazingly inventive poet died on April 2 and yet was able to infuse the writing of this, his last poem, with such high spirits that it almost becomes a cheerful missive to us from that other world from which no traveler has ever returned.<br> <br>Our poems are haunted, as our lives are, by that unknown territory on the other side of a wall too high to climb and see over. In The Best American Poetry 2012 the &#x201c;spirit in the dark&#x201d; comes to light in poems that consider &#x201c;The Gods&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Afterlife,&#x201d; the stories of Magdalene and the road to Emmaus. The poems wonder where &#x201c;we go after we die&#x201d;; they whisper rumors of the other side, about which all we know for certain is that it is &#x201c;something entirely else.&#x201d; Mark Doty, who chose the poems for this year&#x2019;s volume, has a keen ear for the poetry of the uncanny. In his poems he has explored heaven as an earthly possibility, has delved into the realm of dreams more real than waking life, has encountered the apparition of a deceased poet obliviously enjoying his lunch at &#x201c;the Eros Diner, corner / of 21st Street.&#x201d; Doty has won acclaim for his poetry (Fire to Fire: New and Selected Poems won the National Book Award for Poetry in 2008) and his prose (Dog Years was a New York Times bestseller in 2007) not only in North America but in the United Kingdom, where he is the sole American ever to receive the T. S. Eliot Prize. He cares deeply about poetry and poets, loves the language, values good writing. He is as sympathetic a reader as I could have wanted, as generous, and as open to new voices. Mark writes about poetry with passion and acumen. Read him on Hart Crane or May Swenson, on William Blake&#x2019;s &#x201c;Ah! Sunflower&#x201d; and on Alan Shapiro&#x2019;s, in his book The Art of Description, and you will see why I felt he was an irresistible choice to edit this volume of The Best American Poetry.<br> <br>To write poetry, to read it, to go to poetry readings, is a way of being in the world, and there will always be those who get suspicious and feel that maybe Plato was right to exclude the poets from his ideal Republic. Poetry, as they see it, is a form of &#x201c;divine madness&#x201d; that can lead you astray like a drug. It may be that all criticism has its origin in this rationalist rejection of the poet&#x2019;s way of being in the world. Faced with uncomprehending or dismissive criticism, the young poet might take heart from something T. S. Eliot once wrote: &#x201c;Upon giving the matter a little attention, we perceive that criticism, far from being a simple and orderly field of beneficent activity, from which impostors can be readily ejected, is no better than a Sunday park of contending and contentious orators, who have not even arrived at the articulation of their differences.&#x201d; To counter the din of contentious oratory, very little of which will help the writer (or reader) in any useful way, I turn instinctively to the rhetorical question that animates Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnet sixty-five: &#x201c;How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, / Whose action is no stronger than a flower?&#x201d;</p><h2>Poppy Done to Death (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 8)</h2><p><p>On the way to a lunch meeting of her local book discussion group, the Uppity Women, small-town Southern librarian Aurora "Roe" Teagarden is shocked and dismayed to find her sister-in-law Poppy lying bloody and dead right outside her own back door. Poppy had her flaws, certainly-she and her husband were having trouble staying faithful to each other-but she didn't deserve to be so brutally murdered.</p><p>Investigating a case like this is never easy, of course, given the gossipy atmosphere of any small town, what with Poppy and her husband's extramarital affairs, the local police detective (who also happens to be a former boyfriend of Roe's) and his seemingly unresolved feelings for Poppy, and the need to protect Poppy's family. But Roe is also coping with a burgeoning romantic relationship as well as the sudden appearance of her teenaged half brother. All in all, it's a lot for one woman to have on her plate, even one as together as Roe.</p><p>Longtime readers and new fans alike will delight in Roe's exploits as she employs her impeccable knowledge of small town politics and enchanting Southern charm to solve the crime in <i>Poppy Done to Death</i>, this wonderful installment of Charlaine Harris' terrific cozy series.</p></p><p>CHARLAINE HARRIS is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author who has been writing for over thirty years. She was born and raised in the Mississippi River Delta area. She is the author of the Aurora Teagarden mysteries, the Shakespeare mysteries, the Harper Connelly mysteries, the Cemetery Girl mysteries, and the Sookie Stackhouse urban fantasy series, which is the basis for the HBO show <i>True Blood</i>. Harris now lives in Texas with her husband.Chapter One Melinda sat next to me at the table nearest the door. We&#x2019;d kept a chair open for Poppy the whole meeting, but she&#x2019;d never shown up. The room was full of Uppity Women, and they&#x2019;d all turned to look at us when Poppy&#x2019;s name had been called and we&#x2019;d had to say she wasn&#x2019;t there. The other Uppities saw a very short woman in her mid-thirties with a ridiculous amount of brown hair and a wonderful pair of green-rimmed glasses, and a taller, very slim, black-haired woman of the same age, who had a narrow and agreeable face. (I was the shorter of the two.) I am sure all the Uppities who could see that far noticed that we had matching expressions, compounded of social smiles and grim eyes. I, personally, planned to rake Poppy over the hottest coals I could find. The president of Uppity Women, Teresa Stanton, was giving us a basilisk glare. &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll continue the meeting with our book discussion,&#x201d; Teresa said, her voice clipped and businesslike. Teresa, aggressively well groomed, had that chin-length haircut that swings forward when you bend your head, as she did now to check the agenda. Her hair always did what it was told, in sharp contrast to mine. I was sure Teresa&#x2019;s hair was scared not to mind. Melinda and I sat through the book discussion in mortified silence, but we tried to look interested and as though we were thinking deep thoughts. I don&#x2019;t know what Melinda&#x2019;s policy was, but mine was to keep silent so I wouldn&#x2019;t draw any more attention. I looked around the room, at the circular tables filled with well-dressed, intelligent women, and I decided that if none of them had ever been disappointed by a relative, they were a lucky bunch. After all, a woman hadn&#x2019;t shown up for a big-deal, high-pressure social engagement. Surely that was not such a rarity. I muttered as much to Melinda, between the book discussion and lunch, and she widened her dark eyes at me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; she said instantly, sounding relieved. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go by and see her after this is over, though. She can&#x2019;t do this to us again.&#x201d; See? Even Melinda was taking it personally, and she&#x2019;s much more well balanced than I. We scooted out of the dining room as quickly as we politely could after Teresa had dismissed the meeting. But we were waylaid by Mrs. Cole Stewart, who inquired in her deep southern voice where Poppy was. We could only shake our heads in ignorance and mutter a lame excuse. Mrs. Cole Stewart was seventy-five, white-haired, and all of a hundred pounds, and she was absolutely terrifying. From her affronted stare, we clearly received the message that we were being charged with guilt by association. When we got to my Volvo, Melinda said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going over there and have a few words with her.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t say no. In fact, I&#x2019;d never considered any other course of action. &#x201c;Oh, yeah,&#x201d; I said grimly. I was so focused on having a few choice words with Poppy that I couldn&#x2019;t enjoy the clear, chilly November day, and November is one of my favorites. If we passed anyone we should have waved at, we never noticed it. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t as if she does a lot of work around the house,&#x201d; Melinda said suddenly, apropos of nothing. But I nodded, understanding the extended thought. Poppy didn&#x2019;t work outside the home anymore, she had one baby, and she didn&#x2019;t even take very good care of the house, though she did take good care of the baby. She should have been able to manage what was on her plate, as my mother would have put it. As I&#x2019;d half-expected, when we got to Poppy&#x2019;s and saw that her car was still parked in the carport, Melinda quailed. &#x201c;You go in there, Roe,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m liable to get so mad, I might mention a whole lot of other things besides the topic at hand.&#x201d; We exchanged a meaningful glance, the kind that encompassed a whole conversation. I swung my legs out of the car. I noticed something on the ground by my feet, two long straps of embroidered cloth. &#x201c;Oh crap,&#x201d; I said, glad only Melinda was there to hear me. I tossed them into the car for Melinda to look at, and I marched to the front door. I was mentally loaded for bear. &#x201c;Poppy!&#x201d; I called as I turned the doorknob of the front door of the house. The door opened. Unlocked. Since by now I knew Poppy had already had company that morning, I was not so startled by this. I stepped into the foyer and called again. But the house was quiet. Moosie, Poppy&#x2019;s cat, came to see what was happening. Moosie was a pale sylph compared to my huge feline basketball, Madeleine. The cat meowed in an agitated way and ran from hall to kitchen and back again. I&#x2019;d never seen Moosie act so jittery. He was Poppy&#x2019;s pampered pet, a declawed half Siamese she&#x2019;d adopted from the animal shelter. Moosie was not allowed out the front door, only out the sliding glass back door, which led into a backyard enclosed all the way around with a six-foot-high privacy fence. After Moosie stropped my ankles a couple of times, I registered the fact that the sensation was sticky. I looked down and saw that my hose were stained. &#x201c;Moosie, what have you been into?&#x201d; I asked. Several unpleasant possibilities crossed my mind. The cat began cleaning himself vigorously, licking at the dark patch on his side. He didn&#x2019;t seem hurt or anything, just, well, catty. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Poppy?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your momma?&#x201d; I know that&#x2019;s disgusting, but when you&#x2019;re alone with animals, you get that way. Poppy and John David actually had a human child, Chase, as well as the cat, but they&#x2019;d had the cat longer. &#x201c;Hey, Poppy!&#x201d; I yelled up the stairs. Maybe she&#x2019;d gotten in the shower after her visitor left. But why would she? Even for Poppy, missing such an important engagement was very unusual. And if she&#x2019;d been up to her usual shenanigans &#x2026; I had to press my lips together to hold in my anger. I stomped up the stairs, yelling Poppy&#x2019;s name the whole time. She&#x2019;d missed Uppity Women, and she&#x2019;d missed lunch, and, by golly, I wanted to know why. The master bedroom looked as though she&#x2019;d just stepped out. The bed was made and her bathrobe was tossed across the foot of the bed. Poppy&#x2019;s bedroom slippers, the slide-in kind, were in a little heap on the floor. Her brush was tossed down on her dressing table, clogged with red-gold hair. &#x201c;Poppy?&#x201d; I said, less certainly this time. The bathroom door was wide open, and I could see the shower enclosure. The wall was dry. It had been quite awhile since Poppy had showered. I could see my reflection in the huge mirror that topped the two sinks, and I looked scared. My glasses were sliding down my nose, which is a very insignificant feature of my face. I&#x2019;d worn the green-rimmed ones today to offset my bronze-colored jacket and tobacco brown sheath, and I took a little moment to reflect that autumn colors were really my best. Well, I could think about myself any old time, but right now I needed to be searching. I went back down the stairs faster than I&#x2019;d gone up. Melinda, waiting out in my Volvo, would be wondering what had happened to me. I, however, was wondering why the central heating was roaring away on this cool but moderate day, and why I was feeling a draft of chilly air despite the heating system&#x2019;s best attempts. I muttered a less ladylike word under my breath as I strode farther down the entrance hall to the kitchen, though striding is a moot word to use when you&#x2019;re four eleven. Moosie wove in and out between my ankles and darted ahead when it suited him. The kitchen was a mess; although big and bright, it was scattered with dishes and crumbs and pieces of mail and baby bottles and car keys and the St. James Altar Guild schedule&#x2014;a normal kitchen, in other words. To my left, dividing the room in half, was a breakfast bar. On the other side of it was a family dining table, positioned by the sliding glass doors so Poppy and John David could look outside while they ate. A mug of coffee was on the breakfast bar. It was full. I laid my finger against the side of it. Cold. Over the top of the breakfast bar, I could see that the sliding glass door was open. This was the source of the intruding cool air. A sharp-edged wind from the east was gusting into the kitchen. My scalp began to prickle. I stepped through the narrow passage between the end of the breakfast bar and the refrigerator and looked to my right. Poppy was lying on the floor just inside the open sliding glass door. One of her brown pumps had fallen off her narrow foot. Her sweater and skirt were covered in blotches. A spray of blood had dried on the glass of the doors. I could hear a radio playing from the house behind Poppy&#x2019;s. The tune wafted over the high privacy fence. I could hear someone splashing through the water of a pool: Cara Embler, doing her laps, as she did every day, unless her pool was actually frozen. Poppy, who had laughed about Cara&#x2019;s adherence to such an uncomfortable regimen, would never laugh again. The processes of life and living, continuing in the houses all around us, had come to dead stop here in this house on Swan-son Lane. Moosie sat by Poppy&#x2019;s pathetic, horrible body. He said, &#x201c;Reow.&#x201d; He pressed against her side. His food bowl, on a mat by the breakfast bar, was empty. Now I knew how Moosie&#x2019;s fur had gotten stained. He&#x2019;d been trying to rouse Poppy, maybe so she would feed him. Suddenly, I had to escape from that suburban kitchen with its horrible secret. I flew out of the house, slamming the front door behind me. I had a fleeting impulse to scoop up Moosie, but tak...</p><h2>White Shadow</h2><p>A stunning thriller based on the true story of the death of retired criminal kingpin Charlie Wall-and those who benefited from it.</p><p><b>ACE ATKINS</b> is the author of eleven previous books, including two Quinn Colson novels, <i>The Ranger</i>&#x2014;nominated for the 2012 Edgar Award for Best Novel&#x2014;and <i>The Lost Ones</i>.

A pro at age 14, he played for the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues against stars like Satchel Paige and "Cool Papa" Bell. At 20, he joined the New York Giants, then managed by Leo Durocher, whom he credits with "making" his career by showing faith in him after his inauspicious big-league debut. He writes of his years in New York, in San Francisco, where the fans originally were chilly to him, and in New York again, with the Mets. And there is a brief but informative segment on his postbaseball career, which he initially found traumatizing because his adolescence and adulthood had been spent as a ballplayer. Mays founded and directs the Say Hey Foundation, a fund for the education of youngsters. This is an autobiography long overdue and eminently readable. Photos not seen by PW. First serial to the Los Angeles Times syndicate; paperback rights to Pocket Books; Literary Guild alternate. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Mays was a rookie outfielder when Bobby Thomson's home run won the National League pennant for the New York Giants. Twenty-three years later, he ended his career in New York as a Met. In the intervening years, he appeared in 24 All-Star games and was chosen most valuable player twice. This long-awaited autobiography reveals Mays to be a fine man as well as someone who played baseball for the love of the game. The reminiscences of his relationship with manager Leo Durocher, his dismay at the Giants's move to San Francisco, and his early years with the Black Barons of the Negro Leagues are the highlights of this unpretentious look at the career of a baseball legend.

It is about how wrenching it is to give away something born of your flesh, even if you know it&#x2019;s the right decision. It&#x2019;s about how much we can learn from people very much different from us.

Clearly, nothing in the world feels as quiet as the silence of a mother. There were no other cars on the Indiana interstate that day. Snow was pouring out of the sky and the road was slick. I thought about offering to drive but when I looked over, I dared not speak. <br><br>It was early January 1979. &#x201c;Baby, I Love Your Way&#x201d; was playing on the car radio. I had just turned seventeen and was a very young senior in high school. Young, not because I was smart and skipped a grade, but probably because my parents wanted to get me off to kindergarten as soon as possible. There were a lot of kids in our house: I was born number five out of seven children in nine years. My brothers were the oldest and then came the five girls. Our mom called us her army and sometimes her crowd, and maybe most fitting, her herd. Being a part of an army, crowd, herd, had great value as a little kid. There&#x2019;s a sort of mob identity thing that goes on in big families, a free pass that you can take advantage of. Other parents, older siblings, neighbors, teachers, coaches, people, give a nod when you&#x2019;re one of so many. A nod that says, &#x201c;Oh yeah, you&#x2019;re okay, you&#x2019;re one of them.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s like having a little something extra inside that reminds you you belong somewhere in the world, and it never goes away. I&#x2019;d grown up my whole life knowing I was loved. Knowing I would always have a place I belonged.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t think much about the way we grew up; it was just my life, and up to that point almost all of it had been spent in our hometown of Winnetka, Illinois, a small community thirty minutes north of Chicago, perched like a Norman Rockwell painting on the edge of Lake Michigan. We lived in a gigantic house with three stories, eleven bedrooms, four fireplaces, and a killer basement. In the winters we made snow forts in our backyard, and our tree-�lined driveway covered with snow looked like a fairy-�tale wonderland. But the best thing about that great house was how perfectly it fit our army of family: seven kids and two parents.<br><br>My dad grew up the son of a naval captain and went to boarding school in Connecticut before heading off to college. He worked for IBM after graduation, and then came the Pryor Corporation, a business he started on his own in our garage before I was born. Our mom, well, she was the president of us. She did everything that had anything to do with the seven of us and our home. She drove, fed, nursed, looked after, scolded, praised, and kept the ship running, every day. Our mom spent her entire life within the protected walls of the North Shore. Her parents still lived just a mile or two away from us. After Catholic high school, she went down the street to college at Northwestern University, where she majored in theatre and starred in most of their musical theater productions. She met and fell in love with my dad at Northwestern and married him soon after graduation. They settled in the area, and quickly we kids arrived, one after another.<br><br>Northwestern University was a beautiful sight. Every time we drove past the ivy-�covered brick buildings, set back on the edge of Lake Michigan, our mom pointed out the sorority where she&#x2019;d lived and the fraternity where my dad had lived. I&#x2019;d watch the college kids walking with their backpacks, holding hands and being young, and found it near impossible to imagine that could ever have been our mom and dad&#x2014;that they could have ever been young, �ever been anything other than our parents.<br><br>We finally pulled off the interstate to get gas. It was late morning, the sky was dark, and the snow still hadn&#x2019;t let up. My mom uttered her first words in hours.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you hungry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, thank you, Mom.&#x201d; <br><br>She stepped out of the car and closed the door hard. I leaned over to change the radio station. Frank Sinatra came on singing, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a crush on you.&#x201d; This was the music my mom loved and had been singing my whole life. My grandfather, her dad, was our mother&#x2019;s most cherished confidant. We called him Papa and he was the quietest, kindest man I&#x2019;d ever know. He and my aunt and my mom sang and played music in our living room after family dinners sometimes. I&#x2019;d hide behind the drapes, when we were all supposed to be sleeping, and watch my grandfather play the tiple; it sang straight through my heart the first time I heard it. It had ten strings and looked like a baby guitar. As Papa played, my mother would sit on the couch, her big brown eyes wide and alive. She&#x2019;d tap her high heel on the living room carpet, stand up, arms stretched in the air like she was talking to God, and belt with a voice that thundered through the house. Her beautiful face lit up the room, but it was her verve that was so impossible to ignore.<br><br>On one of those nights when I was about six years old, I found the courage to come out of the drapes and ask my grandfather if he would teach me to play that tiple. He answered with a bent little smile, &#x201c;No, this is a useless instrument. It won&#x2019;t exist by the time you grow up. You need to learn to play the guitar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, where&#x2019;s a guitar?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have one, and you&#x2019;re too young, Liz. I&#x2019;ll teach you when you&#x2019;re eight or nine.&#x201d;<br><br>What? That was a hundred years away. I committed the rest of that year to campaigning for a guitar, declaring on a daily basis that I could not live without it. I put notes all over the house; in drawers, in the fridge, in the bathrooms, in their cars. All of them read, Please, please, please get Liz a guitar, any guitar will do! And then the following Christmas, under the tree, like magic, there sat a guitar bigger than me with a note that read, Here you go, Love, Papa.<br><br>The guitar became like an appendage. It gave me the greatest access to myself I would ever discover. It was like finding a key to the place inside that could help me understand what mattered most in life. The music helped me through and around the things that lived inside me. Once I began, I didn&#x2019;t stop. I wrote, played, and sang for everyone and anyone who would listen. And ultimately, I got a seat with the grown-�ups in our living room. Singing along just like my mom did. <br><br>I watched as my mom crunched her way back through the snow and ice from inside the gas station, carrying a small bag and a cup of coffee. Our mom didn&#x2019;t go anywhere without her high heels. She had heels for every occasion. On that day, she wore her three-�inch-�heel, fur-�lined, zip-�up black leather boots. She navigated the winter ground like a seasoned professional&#x2014;�a lifetime of Chicago winters gave her the practice. She handed me a small carton of milk and a travel box of Ritz crackers. She carefully placed her hot coffee on the floor and then leaned over and flipped off the radio. I knew things were bad, I mean radically bad; that was the first time she&#x2019;d ever, ever turned off Frank Sinatra.<br><br>She made her way back on to the toll road. The quiet was killing me. I wasn&#x2019;t used to this kind of quiet. My mom had been a consummate communicator my entire life; you always knew where you stood because she couldn&#x2019;t stop herself from telling you how she felt. I watched the sad, beaten-�looking farmhouses outside the car window along the interstate. I watched the cold-�looking farmers and their kids bundled up, walking in the fields. For the first time in my life it dawned on me how lucky I was. How incredibly fortunate our family was. We were the people who didn&#x2019;t need or want for things. I had an extraordinary life. I was watching the snow fall in sheets onto the farmhouses when I noticed a little boy riding a snowplow with his dad. I thought back to the time my dad first taught me to ski. I was a tiny kid. We were in Aspen, Colorado, just after Christmas on a perfect, crisp, sunny day. I was gliding along the snow in my new red skis, between my dad&#x2019;s legs. I remember hanging on to his knees for dear life, trying not to fall, listening over and over again to his strong, knowing voice, &#x201c;Bend your knees, Lizzie, and lean forward.&#x201d; With my dad around, I felt like I could do anything. I glanced over at Dorothy, driving in silence, and realized, life wasn&#x2019;t mostly a struggle for our family; it was mostly a ride, a really good ride, actually. But that day in the car, life was doing what it does: It was changing, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I wanted all of this to be a horrible dream. I prayed for that, but I kept opening my eyes to find myself still sitting in the passenger seat as Indiana passed us by. <br><br>The seat was uncomfortable. I reached over to move something nudging me in the side&#x2014;�my mother&#x2019;s black patent leather purse. She&#x2019;d had it ever since I could remember. It was packed full to the brim. Her initials, dpb, were monogrammed in shiny gold thread on the outside flap. Dorothy Bennigsen Pryor. No one said her first name quite like our mom. It was as though there were three syllables when she said it, and only two when anyone else said it. &#x201c;Dorr-�o-�tthy,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say, long and slow. She said a lot of words long and slow. Her hello, particularly on the phone, was the longest hello in the history of the world. &#x201c;Hhhheeeellllooooo?&#x201d; <br><br>She insisted that I answer the phone, &#x201c;Hello, Pryor residence, this is Liz speaking.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s just good manners, she&#x2019;d say, but I couldn&#x2019;t do it. I usually answered with a benign &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Dorothy would quickly correct me. &#x201c;Lizzie, do you realize, when you say hello you sound as though you are grunting, or ill? That sound you make isn&#x2019;t a word; the person on the other end couldn&#x2019;t possibly understand you. The word is pronounced Heellloooo; say it as it is supposed to be said, please.&#x201d; This was the stuff that moved her. I never tested it, but I&#x2019;d guess using the word fuck or shit would have elicited less conflict with our mother than ending a sentence with a preposition, or using a word incorrectly, or failing to enunciate the &#x201c;beaaauuuuttiifffuulll&#x201d; words of the English language. Dorothy didn&#x2019;t just have certain rules or thoughts about life. She lived them, passionately, and acted as though we couldn&#x2019;t exist without truly understanding and living them ourselves. She was unlike any other mother I&#x2019;d ever met, and everyone noticed. It wasn&#x2019;t just her curiously dramatic manner and expression. It was the fact that you could feel when she spoke how much she believed what she was saying. That was the powerful part. There was a sense of plea behind everything she said. A plea you couldn&#x2019;t ignore, because her belief was so potent. Find the good in people; go to church; laugh; be kind; read books; say thank you; look your best; kill them with kindness; you only have one shot to make your first impression&#x2014;�those were the front-�running lessons in our mom&#x2019;s book on life. But none of them were expressed or taught in the usual way. Everything came at us in a Dorothy way, a way that forced itself inside and became a part of us forever.<br><br>The heat in the car was blasting hard, but Dorothy was always cold, and I wasn&#x2019;t about to ask to turn it down. I leaned my cheek against the glass window. Indiana looked like a winter paradise outside now, white and gray and strangely beautiful. The silence in the car was intermittently broken by the clanking sound of my mom&#x2019;s forgotten coffee mugs rolling beneath our seats. I leaned over and looked underneath the seat. Everything in the car reminded me of what I was about to leave behind: my life, my mother, my family, our home, my friends; everything that made me feel like me. The worn, musty carpet smell brought back all the times I&#x2019;d hidden on that same car floor many, many years earlier. <br><br>&#x201c;If a policeman comes, smile and tell him your mom will be right back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom, no, we can&#x2019;t park here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom, you have to find a spot like everyone else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom, come back!&#x201d;<br><br>Inevitably a policeman would approach the car.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, kids. Wow, how many of you are there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Our mom will be right back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, but where is she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, she can&#x2019;t park in the middle of the street and leave you kids in the car.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We told her that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that a real gun?&#x201d;<br><br>Every time a policeman came to the window of our car while our mom was double-�parked doing errands, I&#x2019;d grab my stuffed dog Henry. My aunt Bev had sent me Henry for Christmas when I was seven years old. The instant I saw Henry, I loved him. I&#x2019;d dive to the floor, Henry under my arm, and hide. I&#x2019;d cover myself with my coat, hoping to look like a blob on a messy car floor instead of a kid with a stuffed dog. But mostly I wondered if they put little kids in jail for being left in a car without a mom. I was glad I threw Henry in the side of my suitcase that morning. He&#x2019;d been everywhere with me since I could remember. Maybe he would help remind me of all the things I would need to remember.<br><br>I glanced over at my mom and cleared my throat. &#x201c;Could we pull over so I can use the restroom, Mom?&#x201d;<br><br>She lifted her eyebrows, but didn&#x2019;t say a word. We pulled over a few minutes later. The roadside diner we found was called the Roadside Diner. I wanted to laugh&#x2014;�it was something Dorothy would think was funny and stupid&#x2014;�but that wasn&#x2019;t going to happen. Not today. I hopped out and ran to the restroom. As I made my way back to the car, I could feel my mom watching me. As soon as I got in, she turned the car around and pulled up next to a funky-�looking man standing by a truck. She rolled down her window and asked, &#x201c;Sir, how much longer until the Greenfield exit?&#x201d;</p><h2>Collage and Assemblage: Trends and Techniques</h2><p>Surveys the history of the art form and details the stenciling, laminating, photocopying, wax resist, and other processes used in applying materials to canvas</p><p></p><h2>Birds of Prey Vol. 1: Endrun</h2><p>Soaring out of BRIGHTEST DAY, the Birds of Prey are back!Oracle, Black Canary, Huntress and Lady Blackhawk all return to Gotham City, where they belong &#x2013; and they&#x2019;ve brought a couple of new friends (or are they foes?) along with them.The Birds of Prey are forced to ally themselves with the worst of Gotham City&#x2019;s mega-criminals while they struggle to save his life from the unspeakable horror that hunts them all.

A Narrow Sea explores the myriad connections, correlations, personalities and antagonisms that have, over the centuries, defined the relationship between these two spirited neighbors. In 120 brief, episodic chapters, the book offers a stirring, panoramic view of a connection that has shaped the course of history. Roving freely across the centuries, from the first migrations of the regions&#39; Paleolithic tribes and their encounters with Greek and Roman explorers, to the grand colonial projects of the Vikings, Normans and Stuarts, this is the story of how a shared culture laid the basis for two very different nations.</p><p></p><h2>Virginia Woolf: To the Lighthouse / The Waves (Columbia Critical Guides)</h2><p><p>Two of Virginia Woolf's most influential works reveal the quintessence of her experimentation with narrative technique in depicting the passage of time and the nature of human consciousness. This guide includes an outline of the critical reception of Woolf's work as well as extracts from her own writing on these novels and an exploration of the birth of "Woolf studies" in the mid-twentieth century.</p></p><p>A central figure in the development of English fiction, Virginia Woolf is recognised as one of the most original novelists of the Twenties and Thirties. Determined to find a new form for the novel, and dedicated to observing and recording the momentary experiences of life, she dispensed with conventional plot and characterisation in her major works, experimenting with narrative technique and the passage of time in human consciousness. For its technical innovation and its important contribution to the modernist movement in English fiction, Woolf's work has been the subject of critical interest for over sixty years. <br><br>In this Readers' Guide, Jane Goldman explores critical material on <em>To the Lighthouse</em> and <em>The Waves</em>, two of Woolf's most important novels. The reader is guided through the critical debates that have centred on the novels, and is given a clear view of the widening scope of 'Woolf Studies' in the Nineties. The Guide includes extracts from the more recent innovatory work of Rachel Bowlby and Gillian Beer, as well as a significant revisionary essay from Jane Marcus, which has opened up important debates on race and Empire in 'Woolf Studies'.Jane Goldman teaches at the University of Dundee, Scotland.</p><h2>Maigret on the Defensive</h2><p>Chief Inspector Jules Maigret&#39;s career is on the line when the niece of a prominent Parisian lawyer accuses him of sexual molestation and he must prove his innocence</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Shoebag</h2><p>Awakening one morning to find that he has turned into a little boy, Shoebag the cockroach is adopted by the Biddle family and assimilated into human life, but he still yearns to be the roach he once was. Reprint.</p><p>M. E. KERR is the acclaimed author of many classic teen novels, including Dinky Hocker Shoots Smack!, The Books of Fell, Slap Your Sides, and What Became of Her. She lives in East Hampton, New York.Grade 4-6 --In a nifty twist on Kafka, a la Metamorphosis , this "popular young-adult author" asks readers to imagine the revulsion a cockroach might feel at having been suddenly transmuted into a boy. She introduces Shoebag (named for his birthplace), erstwhile insect-son of Drainboard and Under The Toaster. Adopted by the Biddles (in whose house he has always been a resident, however undesirable), renamed Stuart Bagg, poor Shoebag confronts the unknown worlds of humanity and school. Although now large enough to exterminate roach predators that prey on his extended family, Shoebag discovers his new incarnation carries no killer mentality. He bands together with other social outcasts in the cafeteria, and soon their mutual need becomes their collective strength. Shoebag learns that being human has advantages, but he still longs for the form he sees in the mirror--his real self. Still, friendships with others are rewarding and a growing relationship with his human sister, Eunice "Pretty Soft" Biddle--the protected, isolated, insulated star of toilet tissue commercials--is enlightening to them both. When given a chance to return to roachdom, Shoebag assumes cerci and antennae with scarcely a look back, scampering off to the figurative bosom of his family. His departure leaves Pretty Soft discovering herself to be Eunice at last, sure of her image without benefit of mirrors, ready to face reality. Unusual (to say the least), amusing, engaging, and gripping, Shoebag has its lessons carefully hidden in its rather unique plot, and will surely leave its readers surreptitiously cancelling parental appointments with the exterminator and carefully hiding tidbits in inconspicuous corners for the benefit of Shoebag's extended clan.

They also have a dachshund named Rose and something else named Rex. Mr. Joyce has produced two animated television shows based on his books: <em>Rolie Polie Olie</em> and <em>George Shrinks</em>. He also produced and designed the animated feature film <em>Robots</em>. Every once in a while he does a cover for <em>The New Yorker</em>. His alarmingly optimistic picture books include <em>Dinosaur Bob and His Adventures with the Family Lazardo, Santa Calls, The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs,</em> and <em>Bently &amp; Egg</em>.He is currently futzing around on several books and stories that embrace the alleged healing power of heroically scaled silliness.</p>PreSchool-Grade 3 This droll tale of dinosaur ``pethood'' will bring to mind various animal predicaments from other books about oversized creatures: Bridwell's ``Clifford the Big Red Dog'' series (Scholastic) for example, or Kellogg's The Mysterious Tadpole (Dial, 1977). Bob the dinosaur is a friendly sort, who plays the trumpet, can scare off burglars, and loves to play baseball. But his playful antics result in trouble when the police arrest him for chasing cars with his dog friends and disturbing the peace. His baseball skills come to the rescue when he helps the Pimlico Pirates win their opening game. Bob is forgiven and joins the Lazardo family in a musical cookout celebration under the stars. The illustrations, more than the plot, are what will stick in readers' minds. Deep, rich colors and Bob's smooth, verdant hide add a sort of dreamy quality to the pictures, which complement the understated humor of the story. The setting seems to be based more on images from old movies than any one era, giving an added dimension of humor. The pictures have a picaresque quality similar to, but not as stylized as, Roy Gerrard's work in The Favershams (Farrar, 1987). Overall, a nice choice for a young child's bedtime story, or an older child's reading and perusal. Cathryn A.

It doesn't have to be something big, yet if each of us does something every day to reach out to those around us, we are making a difference.There have been numerous print and television media stories about him since his death, yet none have delved so deeply into the spirit of John Denver. He was more than a singer and songwriter, John was a communicator. . . speaking for so many of us through not only his songs, but also in the way he lived his life. To understand the man, we must look at his life closely: Whom did he consider his mentors and teachers? What were his spiritual beliefs? What gave John the strength to continue in the face of his own personal adversities? What books did John read? <strong>A Mountain in The Wind</strong> calls to each of us, it is more than a biography of John Denver; it can also be a blueprint for transformation.</p><p><b>Christine Smith</b> is a professional writer, environmental and social justice activist, and Founder/President of the nationwide 501c3 nonprofit Dreams of Freedom, Inc.

Thus far, space has traditionally been viewed by narratologists as a backdrop to plot. This study argues that space serves important but under-explored narrative roles: It can be a focus of attention, a bearer of symbolic meaning, an object of emotional investment, a means of strategic planning, a principle of organization, and a supporting medium.<br> Space intersects with narrative in two principal ways: &#x2018;&#x2018;Narrating space&#x2019;&#x2019; considers space as an object of representation, while &#x2018;&#x2018;spatializing narrative&#x2019;&#x2019; approaches space as the environment in which narrative is physically deployed. The inscription of narrative in real space is illustrated by such forms as technology-supported locative narratives, street names, and historical/heritage site and museum displays. While narratologists are best equipped to deal with the narration of space, geographers can make significant contributions to narratology by drawing attention to the spatialization of narrative. By bringing these two approaches together&#x2014;and thereby building a bridge between narratology and geography&#x2014;<i>Narrating Space / Spatializing Narrative</i> yields both a deepened understanding of human spatial experience and greater insight into narrative theory and poetic forms.</p></p><p>Marie-Laure Ryan is an independent scholar and author of <i>Narrative as Virtual Reality: Immersion and Interactivity in Literature and Electronic Media</i>. Kenneth Foote is Professor and Department Head in Geography at the University of Connecticut. Maoz Azaryahu is Professor of Geography and Environmental Studies at the University of Haifa.&#x201c;<i>Narrating Space / Spatializing Narrative: Where Narratology and Geography Meet</i> thoroughly succeeds in what it has set out to do: to create a genuinely interdisciplinary conversation between geography and narratology. This conversation about space and place, text and narrative, at once generates useful terms and methods of inquiry and models them through analyses of a wide spectrum of examples. Its interdisciplinary approach should bring it an appreciative audience across narratology, literature, and geography, and potentially in other fields that have involved themselves in &#x2018;the spatial turn,&#x2019; such as art history, sociology, and philosophy.&#x201d; &#x2014;Karen Jacobs, University of Colorado Boulder<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Narrating Space / Spatializing Narratives</i>&nbsp;is a timely and important book. Written in an accessible style, well structured, and with a wealth of practical case studies, it will speak to students and researchers across disciplinary boundaries.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Lieven Ameel,&nbsp;<i>Social &amp; Cultural Geography</i></p><h2>The Diary of Lieutenant von Bardeleben and Other von Donop Regiment</h2><p>Contains the wartime diaries of Lieutenant Johann Heinrich von Bardeleben, the company Church Book of the von Donop Regiment compiled by Chaplain Georg Christoph Coester, and the regimental journal of Quartermaster Johann Georg Zinn.

In <i>Natural Grace</i>, authors Rupert Sheldrake and Matthew Fox show that not only is the synthesis of science and spirituality possible, but it is truly unavoidable when one considers the extraordinary insights they have both come upon in their work. Sheldrake, who has changed the face of modern science with his groundbreaking theory of morphic resonance, and Fox, whose work in creation spirituality has had a significant impact on people's sense of spirit, balance each other perfectly with their utterly unique yet highly complementary points of view. In this inspired series of talks a variety of ancient topics--including ritual, prayer, the soul, and the nature of are freed from the past and given new power for the future. Through these valuable exchanges, readers will gain deeper insight into the mysteries of the universe and discover a truly majestic sense of the sacred in everyday life. Dynamic and thought-provoking, what results from these dialogues is truly greater than the sum of its parts and will provide science and religion with much to consider for the twenty-first century.</p><p>Matthew Fox is president of the new University of Creation Spirituality in Oakland, California.A graceful and illuminating spiritual conversation between a well-known theologian and a cutting-edge scientist. Fox, an Episcopal priest and author of several books on spirituality (On Becoming a Musical, Mystical Bear, 1972, etc.), here engages in a unique conversation with Sheldrake (Seven Experiments That Could Change the World, 1995), a British scientist and former research fellow at Cambridge University. Their dialogue encompasses prayer, darkness, ecology, mysticism, and the soul; what emerges from their provocative insights is the sense that the gap between science and religion is perhaps not so wide as Western rationalism might have us believe. Both contend that Westerners have lost touch with their souls--that part of their being which links them to nature and the divine. Fox's contribution is somewhat more accessible than that of Sheldrake, who in criticizing the prevailing scientific worldview occasionally forgets that his readers may need that rationalist perspective explained before it can be thrown out of the window. Readers may also question ``morphic resonance,'' the controversial New Agetype theory that has made Sheldrake famous. He argues that through morphic resonance, ``if rats in Sheffield learn a new trick, rats all around the world should be able to learn it quicker just because it has been learned there.'' But the rest of the conversations are real gems. Both participants are lucid and creative in their approaches to hackneyed theological debates on worship, prayer, and meditation. Both share humbly and honestly from their personal experiences, often speaking anecdotally of the many remarkable people they have encountered in their careers. Fox also draws freely from the wisdom of past mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Theresa of Avila, and the effect is like magic. This is a book to be read under a shady tree when one has time to reflect and to enjoy the beauty of nature. (3 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her posthumously published writings are evidence of a strong religious vocation and of unexpectedly radical theological thought, resonating more with contemporary feminist theology and process thought than with the Victorian ideas of her own days. This book shows the complex personality, brilliant mind, and deeply religious motivation of this God-intoxicated woman, who is both a mystic and a militant, an original thinker and great innovative doer. Much of this comes as a great surprise and challenge to the reader. Webb's study is a fine example of the new kind of scholarship on Florence Nightingale. It is a most vivid account and truly engrossing read." ----Ursula King, Center for Comparative Studies in Religion and Gender, University of Bristol </p><p>"Florence Nightingale claimed that her one aim in life was to organize a religion, not a hospital. Val Webb takes the legendary lamp from the sentimental image of Nightingale, to shed new light on the previously undervalued passion of her life. Here we meet Nightingale the mystic and theologian, activist and intellectual, who drank from her own well of experience with impoverished and suffering people. Webb's historical and narrative expertise recovers Nightingale's voice from amongst her Victorian contemporaries to introduce us to a truly innovative and constructive theologian in her own right." ---Nancy Victorin-Vangerud, Lecturer in Systematic Theology, Murdoch University, Australia </p><p>"She was not 'the lady with the lamp.'

Drying it with a low oven is just as easy and Katie Caldesi does a great job of describing the process in her new book, The Gentle Art of Preserving. (. <i>Bakepedia, 7/25/2014</i>)<br><br>Marrons glac�s or candied chestnuts, are often purchased but they can be easily made at home with great success, as long as you follow the directions carefully.

The book is a treasure trove of information and will be used in our Test Kitchen as a great resource for years to come. Try her Fruit Leathers and Low-Sugar Jam as well.

In a career spanning more than fifty years, he has won more awards than any other living fantasist. Ellison has written or edited one hundred fourteen books; more than seventeen hundred stories, essays, articles, and newspaper columns; two dozen teleplays; and a dozen motion pictures. He has won the Hugo Award eight and a half times (shared once); the Nebula Award three times; the Bram Stoker Award, presented by the Horror Writers Association, five times (including the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996); the Edgar Award of the Mystery Writers of America twice; the Georges M�li�s Fantasy Film Award twice; and two Audie Awards (for the best in audio recordings); and he was awarded the Silver Pen for Journalism by PEN, the international writers&#x2019; union.

She sets the stage with background on materials and basic handling, then presents 27 approaches and variations as a series of questions on technique whose answers are full-fledged projects. "How do I make a pinroll cane?" for instance, explains a simple cane process and uses it to cover a candleholder. Other cane methods yield jewelry, a frame, a barrette, drawer pulls, and a covered pen, utilizing both basic canes (bull's eye, banner, checkerboard, blended) and pictorial types (flower, millefiori, star, face, shaman). The final section focuses on molds and textural effects such as metallic and rubber stamp effects to produce brooches, light switch covers, a box, and coasters.

Narrator Charles Chenogne, a cellist in his early 40s, has returned home to Bergheim in Wurttemberg to write a memoir dominated by his relationship with his beloved friend Florent Seinece. The two met in the army in 1963 when Charles was 21, Seinece 24. Charmed by Seinece (a connoisseur of candies, who often playfully breaks into nursery songs), Charles perversely confirms his affection by sleeping with Seinece's wife, Isabelle, ("Ibelle"), so destroying the marriage and the friendship. The affair cools when Charles and Isabelle weary of "ceaseless sensuality . . . like a festering wound." Charles is left glumly to wander, ruminate, fail at love and bury himself in his music, until a last reunion with Seinece. Copious references to word play, art, music and history give a certain erudite preciosity to this inchoate memoir, with each of its chapters set in a different location--e.g., a hunting chalet in the Loire, the Wurttenburg salon--and redolent of Charles's childhood.

Reprint.</p><p><b>Max Lucado</b>, minister for the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, is the husband of Denalyn and father of Jenna, Andrea, and Sara. He is the author of multiple bestsellers and is America's leading inspirational author.Bestselling author Lucado (<i>Come Thirsty</i>) dedicates his latest book to helping readers discover their "sweet spot"&#x2014;the job or life calling they were created for. He guides readers on their search to find the unique abilities God may have built into them. First step: "read your life backward" to see where you've been successful and what you've loved in the past. Readers are directed to find their personal "S.T.O.R.Y."&#x2014;strengths, topic, optimal conditions, relationships and "Yes!" moments. This acronym originates with People Management Inc., whose theories helped Lucado find his own strengths and form much of the foundation for this book. For Lucado, discovering one's life purpose is really about honoring the God who gave the unique abilities in the first place, so he instructs readers not to make decisions based on greed. Instead, he exhorts them to "make a big deal out of God" rather than worrying about their own reputation and to trust God to use their "small beginnings" in his overall purpose. The book contains a "Sweet Spot Discovery Guide" with detailed exercises from People Management to help readers uncover their own personal "S.T.O.R.Y."&#x2014;though some will want further guidance. As always, evangelical readers will appreciate that Lucado is easy to read while still substantive and orthodox, and many struggling to find the work that's right for them will find this book very helpful. <i>(Jan. 3)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A business genius with a penchant for murder, his rackets penetrated the garment, banking, and flour trucking industries in New York.</p><p>Paul R. Kavieff is an engineer and historian who has authored two successful mob books: The Purple Gang: Organized Crime in Detroit 1910-1945 and The Violent Years: Prohibition and the Detroit Mobs. Mr. Kavieff lives in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan.Kavieff's brisk biography of Louis "Lepke" Buchalter, the only major crime boss in U.S. history to be executed, unevenly weaves the labor racketeer's story with that of the bustling early 20th century New York mob scene, resulting in a book that's not quite a biography and not quite an underworld history. Buchalter grew his rackets by foregoing large one-time fees for services rendered-arbitrating, through violence and the threat of violence, "the differences between labor and capital"-in favor of "prolonged strikes that increased the chances for everyone to make a profit." Lepke's association with Murder Inc., "the enforcement branch of the Supreme Court of the underworld" that carried out approximately 1,000 murders between 1931-40, Kavieff suggests, further consolidated Lepke's power and amplified his reputation as a treacherous figure, prompting special mob prosecutor Thomas Dewey and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who described Lepke as "the most dangerous criminal in the U.S.," to put bounties on his head. After going underground, Lepke eliminated witnesses who could help prosecutors secure indictments against him until, tricked into believing he could escape Hughes's prosecution, he surrendered to Hoover. Following a contentious legal saga, Lepke was convicted on drug and racketeering charges and for his involvement in the murder of a small-time underworld figure, the crime that landed him in the electric chair in 1944. Though well-researched, Kavieff's account is told in dry, stilted language and suffers from meandering passages, but readers interested in the seedier side of pre-WWII New York will appreciate Kavieff's gritty portrait of the city's underworld.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a fellow resident of Amherst, Massachusetts, Liebling was naturally drawn to the Homestead, the house in which Dickinson lived and worked. But more remarkably, Liebling had the opportunity to document the opening of the Homestead&#39;s dark sister, the Evergreens -- an Italianate villa built for Emily&#39;s brother, Austin, which until recently was still inhabited but which had been preserved almost as a time capsule of the era of Emily and Austin. Though Dickinson lived as a recluse in the Homestead, she did not live in the utter isolation that has been popularly imagined. Her life was intimately bound up with the affairs of her friends and family, and the domestic situation at the Evergreens inevitably contributed to the environment in which she wrote her poems. Austin Dickinson&#39;s troubled marriage and his affair with Mabel Loomis Todd eventually gave rise to the bitter disputes over the disposition of property and the guardianship of Emily&#39;s poetic legacy that erupted after his death. In Liebling&#39;s evocative photographs, the stark austerity of the Homestead and the decaying opulence of the Evergreens offer new insights into the home life that shaped a poet. Three of the foremost scholars of Dickinson&#39;s life and work have contributed essays that explore the history and legacy of these two dwellings. Polly Longsworth, who wrote the definitive account of Austin&#39;s affair with Mabel Loomis Todd and who is at work on a major new biography of the poet, reveals some of the information her researches have brought to light -- including a new recognition that Dickinson&#39;s anxiety problems were a real and integral condition of her existence, an understanding that demystifies some of the more enigmatic aspects of her life, including her refusal to publish. Barton Levi St. Armand, meanwhile, shares the remarkable and previously untold inside story of Mary Hampson, the last resident of the Evergreens, and of the lives connected with the house over the last century; it was through the efforts of Hampson -- the heir of Austin&#39;s daughter -- that the Evergreens was saved from destruction and is now (like the Homestead) open to the public. Finally, Christopher Benfey offers an insightful appreciation of Liebling&#39;s photographs and the light they shed on Dickinson and her work; he teases out surprising but convincing affinities between the poems and the art of photography. The heart of this book is the one hundred plus photographs through which Jerome Liebling expands our understanding of Emily Dickinson&#39;s world and life. &#34;You might say that the three essays are extended captions,&#34; says Benfey in his introduction, &#34;taking their prompting and provocation from the images.&#34;</p><p>11 x 11 trim. 138 color photographs LC 2001-001810JEROME LIEBLING's photographs have been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, Getty Museum, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and many other museums and galleries in the U.S. as well as England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Japan.

Examining the history of death and of the death sign from sixteenth-century holocaust to contemporary Mexican-American identity politics, anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz's innovative study marks a turning point in understanding Mexico's rich and unique use of death imagery. Unlike contemporary Europeans and Americans, whose denial of death permeates their cultures, the Mexican people display and cultivate a jovial familiarity with death. This intimacy with death has become the cornerstone of Mexico's national identity. Death and Idea of Mexico focuses on the dialectical relationship between dying, killing, and the administration of death, and the very formation of the colonial state, of a rich and variegated popular culture, and of the Mexican nation itself. The elevation of Mexican intimacy with death to the center of national identity is but a moment within that history&#x2015;within a history in which the key institutions of society are built around the claims of the fallen. Based on a stunning range of sources&#x2015;from missionary testimonies to newspaper cartoons, from masterpieces of artistic vanguards to accounts of public executions and political assassinations&#x2015;Death and the Idea of Mexico moves beyond the limited methodology of traditional historiographies of death to probe the depths of a people and a country whose fearless acquaintance with death shapes the very terms of its social compact.</p><p>Claudio Lomnitz is Campbell Family Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University.

He began as an apprentice weaver and developed into a poet and playwright. He served as prot� g� , publisher, or patron of Pope, Johnson, Fielding, Richardson, Voltaire, Rousseau, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Edward Young, Joseph and Thomas Warton, Thomas Gray, Horace Walpole, David Garrick, Tobias Smollett, Oliver Goldsmith, Laurence Sterne, Thomas Percy, Edmund Burke, and others. Virtually all significant mid-century English writers had some connection with Dodsley or with Tully&#x2019; s Head, the bookshop Alexander Pope helped the young Dodsley initiate. Tully&#x2019; s Head, in fact, evolved into the center for the "Athenian Nights" memorialized by Dodsley&#x2019; s friend Samuel Johnson.<br>Harry M. Solomon is the first scholar to integrate recent research by Elizabeth Eisenstein and Alvin Kernin on the impact of print&#x2014; including print&#x2019; s impact on political activism and canon formation&#x2014; into the study of an individual bookseller. Dodsley, he notes, presided over a period of transition: as Edmund Moore observed in a 1753 issue of Dodsley&#x2019; s periodical <i>The World, </i>the old patronage of learning by "the GREAT" has been superseded by "the new patrons, the BOOKSELLERS." Solomon takes this transformation seriously, treating Dodsley as much more than the stereotypical bookseller unimaginatively reacting to the marketplace.<br>Formerly controlled by patronage and state censorship, the world of letters had been shaped by an oral, aristocratic, amateur, authoritarian, and court-centered tradition. Solomon shows Dodsley at the center of the change to a new democratic world of letters, a world driven by print technology and market demand. As the bookseller who played a pivotal role in the careers of both Pope and Johnson, Dodsley published the works of the last genius of the old aristocratic order (Pope) and of the first genius of the new age of print (Johnson).<br>Solomon documents Dodsley&#x2019; s ingenious articulation of his financial interests in newspapers, journals, and book publishing, proving that contrary to the traditional view of booksellers, Dodsley was no insignificant tradesman accidentally associated with genius. Solomon presents Dodsley, in fact, as the most influential English literary force during his lifetime. Chronicling Dodsley&#x2019; s close involvement first with the couplet masterpieces of Pope and Johnson and later with the ambitious odes of Thomas Gray and the Wartons, Solomon argues that Dodsley&#x2019; s enterprises were the impetus for a conscious shift from the Augustan to the Romantic era&#x2014; a shift that mirrors precisely the development of Dodsley&#x2019; s own plays and poems.<br><br></p><p><b>Harry M. Solomon</b> is Hollifield Chair of English Literature at Auburn University.

After a whirlwind courtship, San Francisco artist Kayla is about to fulfill her dream of marrying Mr. Right and starting a family&#x2014;but on the wedding night, her dream man abandons her. Meanwhile, engineer Nick Granville returns home to San Francisco after a few months working in Africa to find his house lived in and his bank accounts plundered. Turns out these two strangers were duped by the same man: handsome, blond, smooth-talking Evan Chadwick. Unable to get the attention of the SFPD, the two marks take it upon themselves to track down Evan and get back what's theirs. As the clues accumulate, so do the smoldering glances between broad-shouldered Nick and curvy Kayla, but Freethy's sex scenes have a reportorial feel that may leave readers cold. Evan's cat and mouse game, however, should hook suspense fans and carry them into the next volume&#x2014;as Evan says, "the game will be over when I say it's over," and this is just his first play. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Living on a string of Camel cigarettes, too many cups of coffee, and bouts of masturbation in his Greenwich Village basement apartment, the writer and recovering alcoholic has been blocked. He stares at the blank pages in his typewriter for longer than he cares to admit, hoping for the spark that will finally fulfill his ambition to write The Great Armenian Novel.</p><p>And then he meets Clyde Potts. She is beautiful, intelligent, charming, perhaps psychic and, for better or worse, very possibly unbalanced. With Potts's joie de vivre and her certified insane partner in crime, Fox Harris, Snow is caught up in a series of pranks against corporate sprawl that they execute with a bit of booze, and some wacky tobaccy from Australia known as Malabimbi Madness. </p><p>But things quickly spin out of control as the trio's ultimate diuretically inspired prank leads to an unexpected, shocking conclusion, and Walter is left to wonder if the only things you ever keep in this life are the things you let slip through your fingers.</p><p>A tale of the nature of sanity, the cost of inspiration, and the art and business of creativity, <em>Kill Two Birds &amp; Get Stoned</em> has the absurd and provocative hijinks that could have only come from the fertile, frenzied mind of veteran soul Kinky Friedman.</p></p><p><p>Kinky Friedman is an author, musician, defender of strays, cigar smoker, and the governor of the heart of Texas.</p>Friedman sends a slumping, unfulfilled novelist off on a wild criminal adventure with a couple of con artists in his latest, an engaging but erratic caper novel that begins when mid-career fiction writer Walter Snow meets the woman of his dreams, Clyde Potts, at a bank in Manhattan. Potts already has a companion, an oddball named Fox Harris who accompanies Clyde on her various criminal ventures, and the pair quickly take advantage of Snow's lust for Potts to convince him to play a role in a smalltime con at a New York bar. Their next escapade takes them to a mental hospital, where they liberate an African-American acquaintance who believes himself to be the king of an African country. The criminal stakes go up when Potts manages to steal Donald Trump's credit card number, and the trio throws a lavish party for the homeless at a New York shelter, but the plotting turns downright bizarre when Potts and Harris sabotage a major coffee cafe after the company that owns the chain evicts the owner of a dive bar called the Unicorn. Friedman's usual off-kilter charm prevails throughout, particularly in the characterization of Snow, a sincere but befuddled writer who uses his lust for Potts to overcome a continuing case of writer's block. Potts and Harris have their endearing moments, but the criminal subplots range from the solidly effective to the over-the-top wacky, particularly the coffee caper, which is designated "Operation Diarrhea" and involves the trio adding a mix of diabolical chemicals to the local brew. Friedman fans will enjoy the antics, but this falls short of top-shelf Kinky.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Reliant Motor Company</h2><p>The Reliant Motor Company, established in 1935 and destined to outlast almost every one of its competitors at the time by staying in business for 66 years, is nevertheless perhaps the most underrated car manufacturer in the world. As a relatively small British motor company positioned on the ancient A5 road where it passes through Tamworth in the English midlands, Reliant initially brought family motoring to the masses with its range of three-wheeler cars and it is maybe still best known for the &#x2018;Robin&#x2019; three wheeler. The complete story of Reliant is much more than a single model however, and in particular the 1970s Scimitar GTE was emulated by almost every other car manufacturer whilst the Scimitar itself became the choice of royalty and celebrities alike. Reliant was also a great innovator, a company that achieved many world firsts and exported vehicles all over the world. Indeed, it was Reliant that created a complete car industry for Israel and Turkey. From early prototypes through Reliant 7cwt to Reliant, Regal, Regent, Kitten, Sabra Sport and of course the Scimitar to the less well known known Scooter Ski, Ant and countless &#x2018;one-offs&#x2019; and projects, The Reliant Motor Company uncovers the full story of the company and its cars which have developed a cult following amongst car owners, enthusiasts and ex-employees alike.'FOREWARD BY HRH THE PRINCESS ROYAL'</p><p></p><h2>The Persian Boy</h2><p>The new monumental bestseller! a towering re-creation of the ancient world of Alexander the Great.</p><p>kes skill to depict, as Miss Renault has done, this half-man, half Courtesan who is so deeply in love with the warrior.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The Atlantic Monthly<br></i><br><b>The Persian Boy</b> traces the last years of Alexander&#x2019;s life through the eyes of his lover, Bagoas.

Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and others--who coalesced into the Beats. Illustrations.</p><p>Watson's no-holds-barred chronicle of Beat writers is part of the Circles of the Twentieth Century series, which is based on the belief that artistic innovation arises out of "constellations" of creative people. The theory is particularly appropriate when it comes to the close, even intimate friendships among the primary figures of the Beat movement: William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg, and their icon and love object, the rapacious Neal Cassady. Watson juggles the life stories of each of these driven fellows in his fluid commentary, which is well supported by photographs, quotes, and sidebars. We learn the pertinent facts about each man's childhood and the winding paths that lead to their fertile, if turbulent relationships, which were based on a shared passion for experimentation with drugs, sexuality, and spontaneous literary expression. Watson covers all their wild adventures, documents the feverish creation of such galvanizing and influential works as <i>On the Road</i>, "Howl," and <i>Naked Lunch</i>, and describes the widening of the Beat circle to include such luminaries as Gary Snyder and Michael McClure. The Beats' fusion of life, legend, and literature was gutsy, unique, and indelible, and recognition of their importance continues to grow. <i>Donna Seaman</i>In the second volume in the series "Circles of the Twentieth Century," devoted to avant-garde writers, Watson (The Harlem Renaissance, Pantheon, 1995) traces the lives of Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, and company from their initial meetings in New York to their rise to literary fame. Watson also examines confluent movements like the San Francisco renaissance and the Black Mountain School. Watson offers no startling revelations, but he writes gracefully and has a gift for synthesis. An innovative book design makes interesting use of the margins for quotations, photos, and brief notes.

In 1940, she was studying in Paris when the Blitzkrieg overran the Allied army; she became a nurse in a chateau on the Loire in occupied France, looking after abandoned children, until 1942 when, warned that she was about to be arrested, she escaped across the Pyrenees. After the war she worked in Displaced Persons camps for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in occupied Germany.<br>When Sereny became a writer, the Nazi period and its lasting impact on Germany not surprisingly became one of her main themes. The Healing Wound gathers together the best of Sereny's writings about Germany over fifty years, exploring the guilt, denials, and deceptions that, in many different ways, the Nazis created. She writes about individuals, many of whom she came to know well, who were deeply involved in the events of the period - among others, Franz Stangl, the Commandant of Treblinka, John Demjanjuk, the alleged Ivan the Terrible, Leni Riefenstahl, Francois Genoud, a Swiss man who loved Hitler, and of course Albert Speer.</p><p><b>Gitta Sereny's</b> previous books include <i>Into That Darkness, Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth</i>, and most recently <i>Cries Unheard</i>. Born in Vienna, she lives in London.Reminiscent of the thoughtful writings of Elie Wiesel and Viktor Frankl, these essays by Austrian-born Sereny (Into That Darkness) read at times like short stories connected by the author's quest to comprehend the phenomenon that was German National Socialism. Sereny was a member of the French resistance during World War II, and when she tells a story whether her own or that of one of the many historical figures she has interviewed the work is compelling and thought-provoking. When she philosophizes, however, as she does in one long section on the effect of Nazism on German youth, the work stalls. The writing would have benefited from simplification; many of the sentences are long and complex and are fractured by a profusion of dashes and commas, which endangers their clarity. Still, Sereny writes with insight, passion, and understanding of Hitler's servants and their lingering impact on Germany today. Highly recommended for academic libraries. Michael F.

M.L.C. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>A Taste for Chaos: The Art of Literary Improvisation</h2><p>Western civilization has always driven toward mastering the world through reason, will, craft, and scientific objectivity. Yet beneath this current swirls a riptide that suggests we can know more of the world through non-rational means - through spontaneity, intuition, and creativity. In A Taste For Chaos, literary scholar Randy Fertel explores this undercurrent of spontaneity in literature and identifies a new metagenre called improvisations - texts that claim to have been written without effort or craft, like an idea that hits you in the shower. Whether the authors claim to have written them in a dream, instinctively, off the top of their head, or when drunk, they have done so, so they claim, without effort, and their work is the more valuable because of it. While self-styled spontaneous texts claim to be unlike anything we have ever seen before, they actually abound across genres and time, from the epic sung poetry of classical Greece to 21st century novels. A Taste for Chaos, presents a methodology for talking about spontaneity, and then applies that methodology to landmark texts. Fertel explores the complex nature of the spontaneous gesture; identifies the stylistic conventions, themes, and rhetorical features of improvisations; and explores the archetype of spontaneity throughout history from philosophy and psychology to chaos science, jazz, conceptual art, post-modernism, and finally Hermes - the god of crossing boundaries, of improvisation, who graces the book&#39;s cover. Fertel then provides a fresh approach to major texts of the Western tradition by analyzing them through the lens of improvisation: Milton&#39;s Paradise Lost, Sterne&#39;s Tristram Shandy, Wordsworth&#39;s Tintern Abbey, Tennyson&#39;s Idylls of the King, Mark Twain&#39;s Huckleberry Finn, Jung&#39;s Red Book, Joyce&#39;s Ulysses, Mann&#39;s Dr. Faustus, and finally, McEwan&#39;s Saturday. Woven throughout these improvisations, demonstrates Fertel, is the lesson that we can ultimately know more of the world by accepting the limits of reason, and opening up rationality to more of life.</p><p><b><i>A Taste for Chaos </i></b>was inspired by one of those rare moments when I managed to think outside the box. Suddenly I was looking at spontaneity in a completely different light. You know, spontaneity: acting off the cuff, no cards your sleeve, not breaking a sweat. From the Latin <i>sua sponte</i> - of one's free will. You just do it. But how does it happen? Is it the Muse? Is it one drink too many or, to coin a phrase, one drink just enough? When you're not totally in control of that alchemical mix of impulse and instinct. When you're "in the zone" where the idea, the artwork, poem, play, essay, speech, or song comes without thought and effort. Such a state is what we all long to attain.For William Faulkner "the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself ... alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat." This longing for spontaneity is then part of a larger conflict, maybe the ultimate conflict of the heart, that is, the conflict between the heart and the head. We long for the truth of the heart but inevitably the head will have some role in understanding it. The longing for spontaneity--for unmediated experience, for seeing not through a glass darkly but face to face, for experience unmuddled by the head and the artifice and logic the head is heir to; all of that is inevitably in conflict with our other longing: for mastery of the world through logic and intellect and craft. So spontaneity is part of a larger conflict, the conflict between the inartificial and the artificial, what is divinely or in some other extra-human inspiration and our hard work. Spontaneity and the form it has taken since the dawn of literature was my way into tackling all that.The first thing is not to play the Goldilocks Game debating whether the improvisation is improvised too much ("That's not writing, that's typing"--Capote on Kerouac), too little or not really improvised (e.g. Adorno on jazz), or just right. Far more interesting is to trace the ways that the claim of spontaneity ushers us into a world where the value of craft and rationality are questioned and alternatives to craft and rationality are explored and promoted. If as Val�ry said, Everything changes but the <i>avant-garde,</i>" improvisation is&nbsp;the&nbsp;perennial discourse of the&nbsp;<i>avant-garde. </i><b><i>A Taste for Chaos </i></b>explores that at once mutable and&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;form.<b>Randy Fertel</b>&nbsp;holds a Ph.D. in English and American literature from Harvard University, where he received a student-voted teaching award.

And even though such organisms would not likely be able to harm humans, the possibility exists that first contact might be our last.<p> That's the scientific supposition that Michael Crichton formulates and follows out to its conclusion in his excellent debut novel, <i>The Andromeda Strain</i>. </p><p>A Nobel-Prize-winning bacteriologist, Jeremy Stone, urges the president to approve an extraterrestrial decontamination facility to sterilize returning astronauts, satellites, and spacecraft that might carry an "unknown biologic agent." The government agrees, almost too quickly, to build the top-secret Wildfire Lab in the desert of Nevada. Shortly thereafter, unbeknownst to Stone, the U.S. Army initiates the "Scoop" satellite program, an attempt to actively collect space pathogens for use in biological warfare. When Scoop VII crashes a couple years later in the isolated Arizona town of Piedmont, the Army ends up getting more than it asked for.</p><p> <i>The Andromeda Strain</i> follows Stone and rest of the scientific team mobilized to react to the Scoop crash as they scramble to understand and contain a strange and deadly outbreak.

Postcolonial Practice of Ministry is a groundbreaking anthology that enables a new engagement between postcolonial and practical theologies, focused on three key areas of the practice of ministry: pastoral leadership, liturgical celebration, and interfaith engagement. <br> <br>Postcolonial Practice of Ministry will make an impact in at least two areas of theological reflection: first, among postcolonial scholars, it will stretch postcolonial theology into an area where it has been neglected; second, it will provide a comprehensive resource for rethinking the practice of ministry. Contributors to this volume are well-known scholars from different racial, national, and denominational backgrounds, bringing with them experiences of hybrid identities and multicultural churches. Many of them are pioneers in introducing postcolonial discourse to their fields.</p><p>Kwok Pui-lan is William F. Cole Professor of Christian Theology and Spirituality at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.<br><br>StephenBurns is Stewart Distinguished Lecturer in Liturgical and Practical Theology, co-coordinator of ministerial formation, and associate dean of Trinity College Theological School, University of Melbourne, Australia.This book was helpful for me as I continue to explore the implications of postcolonial theory in ministry and practical theology. The useful bibliographies point the reader to recent important contributions in these fields. As any good scholarship does, this book not only answered questions for me, but it also gave me new questions to pose.... I recommend this book to both scholars and practitioners who care about how to minister to all people. (<i>Reading Religion</i>)<br><br>The book offers a vision for a contemporary church facing issues of globalization and pluralization, a church committed to a renewed repentance for what in our own Christian history has torn at and disrupted the missio Dei which humans collaborate in. It is written for pastors, for teachers, for seminarians, for those committed to exploring new models of liturgy, new models of leadership, and new models of interfaith dialogue. Every seminary library should own it, and every church leader looking forward to the next decades of church life should find a way to check it out. (<i>The Anglican Theological Review</i>)<br><br>Postcolonial Practice of Ministry is most helpful in making postcolonial thought relevant to theology, worship, and pastoral practice. . . . I strongly recommend it the readers of Worship. (<i>Worship</i>)<br><br>Postcolonial Practice of Ministry is a first and much-needed anthology that offers the lens of postcolonial perspectives to inform and revise practices of ministry such as care, liturgy, and interfaith collaboration. The editors&#x2019; introduction and epilogue offer an engaging orientation to postcolonial thought. Each chapter is an invitation on the journey of decolonizing our Western minds and hearts to imagine more expansively practices of ministry and theological wisdom shaped by the authenticity of our global diversity. I welcome the availability of this resource. (Nancy J. Ramsay, Brite Divinity School)<br><br>A truly landmark volume! And a book absolutely essential for moving postcolonial &#x2018;theory&#x2019; beyond the hallowed halls of the Western academy and into the world. This wonderful collection weds two endeavors&#x2014;postcolonial theology and practical theology&#x2014;to disrupt colonization and imperialism on the ground and portray what a de-colonizing Christian theology and faith might look like in everyday life, religious practices, and ministry.

Until then, Franz Huchel&#x2019;s life had trickled along fairly uneventfully, but this thunderstorm was to give it a sudden turn that had far-reaching consequences. As soon as he heard the first, distant rumble of thunder, Franz ran inside the little fisherman&#x2019;s cottage where he lived with his mother in the village of Nussdorf am Attersee, and crawled into bed to listen to the unearthly racket from the safety of his warm and downy cave. The weather shook the hut on every side. The beams groaned, the shutters banged outside, and the wooden roof shingles, thickly overgrown with moss, flapped in the storm. Rain pelted against the windowpanes, driven by gusts of wind, and on the sills a few decapitated geraniums drowned in their tubs. The iron Jesus on the wall above the old clothes box wobbled as if at any moment he might tear himself from his nails and leap down from the cross; and from the shore of the nearby lake came the crashing of fishing boats slammed against their moorings by the pounding waves.</p><p>When the storm finally died down and a first tentative ray of sun quivered towards his bed across soot-blackened floorboards trodden down by generations of heavy fishermen&#x2019;s boots, Franz felt a sudden small rush of contentment, curled up in a ball, then stuck his head out from under the quilt and looked around. The hut was still standing, Jesus still hung on the cross, and through the window, which was sprinkled with drops of water, a single geranium petal shone like a pale red ray of hope.</p><p>Franz crawled out of bed and went over to the kitchen alcove to boil up a saucepan of coffee and creamy milk. The firewood under the stove had stayed dry and flared up like straw. For a while he sat staring into the bright, flickering flames, until the door flew open with a sudden crash. In the low doorframe stood his mother. Frau Huchel was a slender woman in her forties, still quite good-looking, though somewhat gaunt, like most of the local people: work in the surrounding salt mines, or cattle sheds, or the kitchens of the guesthouses for summer visitors took their toll. She just stood there, panting, one hand resting on the doorpost, her head slightly bowed. Her apron stuck to her body; tangled strands of hair hung down over her forehead, and drops of water were forming and falling one by one from the tip of her nose. Behind her the peak of the Schafberg mountain reared up ominously against the grey, cloud-covered sky, in which blue flecks were already reappearing here and there. Franz was reminded of the lopsided, oddly-carved Madonna someone in the olden days had nailed to the doorframe of the Nussdorf chapel, and which was now weathered almost beyond all recognition.</p><p>&#x2018;Did you get wet, Mama?&#x2019; he asked, poking about in the fire with a green twig. His mother raised her head, and then he saw that she was crying. The tears were mingled with the rainwater, and her shoulders were heaving.</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s happened?&#x2019; he asked in alarm, shoving the twig into the smoking fire. His mother didn&#x2019;t answer; instead, she pushed herself off the doorframe and took a few unsteady steps towards him, only to stop again in the middle of the room. For a moment she seemed to look around her as if searching for something; then she raised her hands in a gesture of helplessness and fell forward onto her knees.</p><p>Franz stepped forward hesitantly, placed his hand on her head and started awkwardly stroking her hair.</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s happened?&#x2019; he repeated hoarsely. He felt suddenly strange, and stupid. Until now it had been the other way round: he had cried, and his mother had stroked him. Her head felt delicate and fragile under his palm; he could feel the warm pulse beneath her scalp.</p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s drowned,&#x2019; she said quietly.</p><p>&#x2018;Who?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Preininger.&#x2019;</p><p>Franz paused. He rested his hand on her head for a few moments longer, then withdrew it. His mother stroked the strands of hair off her forehead. Then she stood up, took a corner of her apron and wiped her face with it.</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re filling the whole cottage with smoke!&#x2019; she said, took the green twig out of the stove and stoked the fire.</p></p><h2>Season of Rage: Hugh Burnett and the Struggle for Civil Rights</h2><p>The last place in North America where black people and white people could not sit down together to share a cup of coffee in a restaurant was not in the Deep South. It was in the small, sleepy Ontario town of Dresden. <br><br>Dresden is the site of Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin. Slaves who made their way north through the Underground Railroad created the thriving Dawn Settlement in Dresden before and during the Civil War. They did not find Utopia on the Canadian side of the border, despite their efforts.<br><br>In 1954 something extraordinary happened. The National Unity Association was a group of African Canadian citizens in Dresden who had challenged the racist attitudes of the 1950s and had forged an alliance with civil rights activists in Toronto to push the Ontario Government for changes to the law in order to outlaw discrimination.<br><br>Despite the law, some business owners continued to refuse to serve blacks. The National Unity Association worked courageously through a variety of means of protest to change attitudes.<br><br>The story of their season of rage is told in this compelling new book.</p><p><b>John Cooper</b> has been a writer all his life. In addition to writing books, he is a corporate communications specialist. His interest in African-Canadian history was sparked as a twelve-year-old, when he read Black Like Me. John co-wrote and edited <i>My Name&#x2019;s Not George</i> and wrote <i>Shadow Running,</i> a book for adults about Ray Lewis. In 2002, he wrote his first book for young adults, <i>Rapid Ray: The Story of Ray Lewis.</i> John Cooper lives in Whitby, Ontario with his wife and three children.Grade 7 Up-Cooper has chosen the small town of Dresden, Ontario, to paint a picture of what life was like for black Canadians in the middle of the last century. One Sunday in the early 1930s, when 12-year-old Hugh Burnett and his younger brother had a hankering for ice cream, they entered a restaurant. The boys were told that they would have to eat in the kitchen. The author writes factually and objectively; however, readers will clearly empathize with the citizens, whose descendants had escaped the horrors of slavery in the U.S. only to find discrimination and racism lurking in the sleepy little towns in which they settled. The event in the restaurant sparked a lifelong crusade for Burnett, who spearheaded the formation of the National Unity Association. What began as a letter-writing campaign resulted in the passing of the "Fair Employment Practices Act." However, the battle was far from over, and Cooper discusses the discrimination and court battles that ensued and the personal toll it took on the Burnett family. A number of archival photos enhance the text. What is really a vignette of events in one small town results in a much broader view of the attitudes of an entire country. An eye-opening story.<i>-Corrina Austin, Locke's Public School, St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His ideas on the art and about the art are fertile, inexhaustible.&#34; Rousseau was a practicing musician and theorist for years before publication of his first Discourse, but until now scholars have neglected these ideas. This graceful translation remedies both those failings by bringing together the Essay, which John T. Scott says &#34;most clearly displays the juncture between Rousseau&#39;s musical theory and his major philosophical works,&#34; with a comprehensive selection of the musical writings. Many of the latter are responses to authors like Rameau, Grimm, and Raynal, and a unique feature of this edition is the inclusion of writings by these authors to help establish the historical and ideological contexts of Rousseau&#39;s writings and the intellectual exchanges of which they are a part. With an introduction that provides historical background, traces the development of Rousseau&#39;s musical theory, and shows that these writings are not an isolated part of his oeuvre but instead are animated by the same &#34;system,&#34; this volume fashions a much-needed portal through which literary scholars, musicologists, historians, and political theorists can enter into an important but hitherto overlooked chamber of Rousseau&#39;s vast intellectual palace.</p><p>6 1/8 x 9 1/4 trim. 2 illus. 5 tables.

The decades around 1600 saw sweeping cultural changes in Europe, with the waning of an old-world view and the beginnings of the 17th-century intellectual revolution. The author argues that the conflict which played itself out in the Hapsburg lands during these years was a political manifestation of the intellectual confrontation between the old guard and and their preoccupation with the mystical, spiritual and hermetic sciences, and the rise of a more rational and empirical view of the world. Rudolf, as the embodiment of the old philosophy, failed to grasp this profound shift in the prevailing climate of thought: Professor Evans argues that it was this failure which led to his eventual tragic downfall.</p><p></p><h2>The Against Taffy Sinclair Club (A Bantam-Skylark Book)</h2><p>It was bad enough when snobby Taffy Sinclair was just a pretty face.

The essays and interviews collected here form a vivid panorama of the range and unity of Sartre&#x2019;s interests, since his deliberate attempt to wed his original existentialism to a rethought Marxism. </p> <p> </p> <p>A long and brilliant autobiographical interview, given to <em>New Left Review</em> in 1969, constitutes the best single overview of Sartre&#x2019;s whole intellectual evolution. Three analytic texts on the US war in Vietnam, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the lessons of the May Revolt in France, define his political positions as a revolutionary socialist. Questions of philosophy and aesthetics are explored in essays on Kierkegaard, Mallarme and Tintoretto. Another section of the collection explores Sartre&#x2019;s critical attitude to orthodox psychoanalysis as a therapy, and is accompanied by rejoinders from colleagues on his journal <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>. The volume concludes with a prolonged reflection on the nature and role of intellectuals and writers in advanced capitalism, and their relationship to the struggles of the exploited and oppressed classes. <em>Between Existentialism and Marxism</em> is an impressive demonstration of the breadth and vitality of Sartre&#x2019;s thought, and its capacity to respond to political and cultural changes in the contemporary world. </p></p><p><b>Jean-Paul Sartre</b> was a prolific philosopher, novelist, public intellectual, biographer, playwright and founder of the journal <i>Les Temps Modernes</i>.

Five years later, father and daughter have come home to Monticello, the family's beloved plantation set high in the lush hills of the Virginia countryside. <br>Though Monticello has suffered from her father's absence, Martha finds it essentially unchanged, even as she has been transformed.

Wright (Wheaton Theology Conference)</h2><p>At the 2010 Wheaton Theology Conference, leading New Testament scholar N. T. Wright and nine other prominent biblical scholars and theologians gathered to consider Wright's prolific body of work. Compiled from their presentations, this volume includes Tom Wright's two main addresses, one on the state of scholarship regarding Jesus and the other on the state of scholarship regarding the apostle Paul. The other nine essays critically interact with these two major themes of Wright's works. Much appreciation is shown, overviews are given, perspective is provided and some pointed questions are also raised. Together these essays represent the best of critical yet charitable dialogue among serious and rigorous scholars on theological themes vital to Christian faith that will propel New Testament scholarship for the next decade to come. With essays by <ul><li>Jeremy Begbie</li><li>Markus Bockmuehl</li><li>Richard B. Hays</li><li>Edith M. Humphrey</li><li>Sylvia Keesmaat and Brian Walsh</li><li>Nicholas Perrin</li><li>Marianne Meye Thompson</li><li>Kevin J. Vanhoozer</li></ul></p><p>Nicholas Perrin holds the Franklin S. Dyrness Chair of Biblical Studies at the Wheaton College Graduate School. Between 2000 and 2003, he was research assistant for N.T. Wright. He is the author and editor of numerous articles and books, including Thomas: The Other Gospel (Westminster John Knox, 2007), Lost in Transmission: What We Can Know about the Words of Jesus (Thomas Nelson, 2007) and most recently Jesus the Temple (Baker Academic and SPCK, 2010).N. T. Wright, a former Anglican bishop and a prolific writer about Jesus, Paul, and the New Testament, receives an up-close analysis in this compilation of essays originally presented at the 2010 Wheaton Theology Conference on his works. The book begins with an incisive introduction that compares and contrasts Wright&#39;s theology and writings with those of one of the first seekers of the historical Jesus, Albert Schweitzer. The book is then divided into two sections, &#34;Jesus and the People of God&#34; and &#34;Paul and the People of God.&#34; In each section, essayists discuss various points Wright makes (or doesn&#39;t make) in his own writings, e.g., the absence of John&#39;s gospel in Wright&#39;s Jesus and the Victory of God. Wright then has a chance to respond to the critiques individually and in longer overviews of his own work. Does this get wonkish at times? A little. But Wright, whose writings on religious history and theology cover such a broad spectrum, is a prime choice for this type of coverage. For larger religion collections. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Hawke</h2><p><p> "Hawke is a fast-paced adventure...truly an exciting read," says Nelson DeMille. "Rich, spellbinding, and absorbing, Hawke is packed with surprises," raves Clive Cussler. Readers beware, this stunning, high-caliber thriller is not recommended for the faint of heart. </p><p> Lord Alexander Hawke is a direct descendant of the legendary English pirate Blackhawke and highly skilled in the cutthroat's deadly ways himself. While still a boy, on a voyage to the Caribbean, Alex Hawke witnesses an act of unspeakable horror. Hidden in a secret compartment on his father's yacht, Alex sees his parents brutally murdered by three modern-day pirates. It is an event that will haunt him for the remainder of his life. Now, fully grown and one of England's most decorated naval heroes, Hawke is back in the same Caribbean waters on a secret mission for the American government. A highly experimental stealth submarine, built by the Soviets just before the end of the Cold War, is missing. She carries forty nuclear warheads and is believed to be in the hands of a very unstable government just ninety miles from the American mainland. Hawke is in a race against time. His mission: Find the deadly sub before a preemptive strike can be launched against the U.S., and confront the murderous men behind the personal nightmare that haunts him before they find him first. </p><p> Featuring breathtaking action, international intrigue, and a hero worthy of the very finest adventure fiction, Hawke heralds the exciting debut of a bold new talent.</p></p><p>A James Bond for the 21st century, Alex Hawke is suave, sexy, smart, wealthy, and deadly. And he's got the bloodlines to prove it--the direct descendant of a famous English pirate, the British secret agent is back in the Caribbean where his ancestor once amassed a legendary fortune and where, decades ago, his own parents were brutally tortured and murdered for a secret Alex, to this day, doesn't know he has in his possession. What brings Alex back to the scene of a crime he only vaguely remembers witnessing as a child is a mission to find and recover a stealth submarine that's gone missing less than a hundred miles from the American mainland, complete with 40 nuclear warheads and a rogue terrorist's finger on the countdown button. It's a hoary premise, but Bell makes it work with skillful plotting, quick characterizations, and a lively hero who deserves a sequel, not to mention the big screen treatment. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Ted Bell</b> is the former Vice-Chairman of the Board and World-Wide Creative Director of one of the world's leading advertising agencies, Young &amp; Rubicam.</p><h2>The Surfer&#39;s Guide to Waves, Coasts and Climates</h2><p>Following international acclaim for &#34;Surf Science: An Introduction to Waves for Surfing&#34; (Alison Hodge, 2002), Tony Butt&#39;s &#34;The Surfer&#39;s Guide to Waves, Coasts and Climates&#34; will appeal to surfers and all those who are fascinated by the sea and the coast.

From scholars to warriors to concubines and queens, &#34;The Scimitar and the Veil gathers scholarship about the women of Islam into one fascinating book presented for general readership. Based on sources ranging from Swahili lore to Persian pageant plays to Muslim feminist writings to the explorations of Western scholars of Islam, The Scimitar and the Veil is written in a poetic, sometimes humorous, energetic and contemporary style that will appeal to a broad range of readers. Muhammad was born to a widowed mother, tended by a slave woman, and fostered by a Bedouin woman. His marriage to Khadija, a wealthy businesswoman from Mecca was long, fruitful, and faithful. She was the first to convert to Islam. From Barakah, Muhammad&#39;s surrogate mother, and Fatima, his cherished daughter, to the Sufi mystic Rabi&#39;a, The Scimitar and the Veil is the first popular history and overview of Muslim women and their great accomplishments. While there are other books about women in Islam, The Scimitar and the Veil is the most comprehensive and written in a style meant to appeal to a general audience.</p><p>Jennifer Heath is the author of The Echoing Green: The Garden in Myth and Memory (Penguin, 2000), On The Edge of Dream: The Women of Celtic Myth and Legend (Penguin 1998), Black Velvet: The Art We Love to Hate (Pomegranate 1994) and A House White With Sorrow: A Ballad for Afghanistan, a novel published by Rodent Press in 1996 and reissued as an illustrated &#34;novel in newspaper form&#34; by Baksun Books in 2002.

According to Eusebius, he was raised in Carthage, the son of a Roman centurion. Following his conversion to the faith, he became an impassioned defender of the rights of Christians. Origen Adamantius (c. 185-254) taught in Alexandria, reviving the catechetical school of Alexandria in which Clement of Alexandria had taught. His translations, commentaries, and theological works mark him as one of the finest minds of early Christianity. John Cassian (c. 360-435), born in Europe, first joined a monastery in Palestine and then traveled to Egypt to learn from the Desert Fathers. After his return to Europe, he founded a monastery in southern France. His writings would eventually influence St. Benedict, who recommended Cassian&#39;s texts to his monks. All three writers in this collection offer reflections on the Lord&#39;s Prayer, together with practical advice for prayer. This common ground provides a basis for comparisons, along with a rich picture of Christian spirituality in the ancient world. At the same time, the authors address questions about prayer that are still relevant today.</p><p></p><h2>Finding Faith: A Self-Discovery Guide for Your Spiritual Quest</h2><p>Is there a God? - What might God be like? - What is the relationship between faith and certainty? - Can intelligent people believe in spiritual realities? - Why are there so many religions? - Is it possible to experience a relationship with God--and if so, how? If you&#39;ve asked questions like these, you&#39;re in good company. From songwriters such as Bob Dylan and Jewel Kilcher to TV shows such as The X Files and Touched by an Angel, the media and the arts reflect postmodern men and women&#39;s search for a living faith and a spiritually oriented life. Real faith isn&#39;t blind believism. It is a process that engages your intellect as well as your emotions. If you think faith requires turning your back on truth and intellectual honesty, then Finding Faith is one book you really ought to read. With logic, passion, and even-handedness that the thinking person will appreciate, this book helps you face your obstacles to faith by focusing not on what to believe, but on how to believe. Whether you want to strengthen the faith you have, renew the faith you lost, or discover faith for the first time, Finding Faith can coach, inspire, encourage, and guide you, and help you discover more in life than you&#39;d ever imagined or hoped for.</p><p>C. S. Lewis&#39; thoughtful, witty, and unpretentious approach in Mere Christianity was unique in its appeal to secular readers. Finding Faith continues the tradition of speaking to a generation of non-Christians in their own world and language. Using contemporary, fade-resistant language and illustrations, Brian McLaren helps today&#39;s baby boomers and busters discover not only what to believe or why to believe, but also how to believe. Finding Faith deals realistically with the questions and choices that confront seekers in our postmodern, pluralistic culture. This is a book Christians can give the skeptics in their lives, confident that it will meet the questions they are asking with intelligent, reasonable, and meaningful answers.Brian D.

Seven years since his world was almost completely destroyed. Seven years of trying to put his life back together and trying to put the past behind him. But sometimes the past doesn't want to stay dead. And sometimes the dead come back to haunt you... </p><p>In Eddie Farris's case, the dead are coming back with a vengeance. Who is the strange, mysterious figure who seems to be following Eddie, taunting him, threatening him? He can't be the person Eddie thinks he is. That man's been dead for seven years. Ever since the night of The Showdown, when Eddie killed him... </p><p>Nothing in Eddie's world is quite what it seems to be, and he will soon discover that you never really escape your destiny; it burns within the fire of your soul...</p></p><p>The doctors say this will help me heal. <p>In the days since I awoke from the white haze, the world has been a blur of blinding lights and muffled noises and distorted memories fading in and out of reality, in and out of my dreams and nightmares. Machines beep and hum. Voices carry down the hallway. Somewhere, someone screams for reasons I can only begin to imagine. </p><p>I'm trapped in my own little hell. </p><p>A personal inferno. </p><p>The lights are bright during the day. At night they dim so I can sleep. That's never a problem, although my dreams are haunted by visions of the recent past. Nothing solid. Every moment is like gazing into a broken mirror. Echoes of confusion. Flashes of movement. But those echoes grow louder and the flashes become brighter with each passing night. </p><p>I'm eighteen years old, and the doctors say I'll recover from my wounds. </p><p>Right now my side aches, as if the bullet is still in there. I feel the burning, like a white-hot knife is being jabbed into my flesh. </p><p>The drugs create a fog in my head, but I can't imagine the pain without them. The pain comes in waves, blinding me, branding my mind. </p><p>I can't remember much. Not yet. </p><p>But I know a way to recover the memories, to rebuild what I once had. </p><p>I told the doctors how I can remember what happened, with a little help from them. </p><p>I told the doctors I used to write every day. </p><p>The act of putting words on paper has helped me through a lot of difficult times. My fears and dreams, spoken through other people's mouths. My fears and dreams, acted through other people's bodies. Nothing real, all fake, all make-believe, yet all reflections of reality. </p><p>After some discussion, the doctors have decided it's what I need to do now: I need to write. </p><p>My memories are distant and disjointed, but I'll try to make this as coherent as I can. </p><p>The doctors tell me to write, so that's what I'll do. </p><p>I'll write about the day my life changed forever. </p><p>I'll try to explain The Showdown, if I can discover what that really means. </p><p>I'll write this down like any other story I've ever dreamed up. </p><p>Like any work of fiction that has ever lived inside my mind, and inside my mind only. </p><p>What I can't remember, I'll piece together along the way. </p><p>I'll pretend it's all make-believe. </p><p>But: </p><p>This is real. </p><p>This is what happened. </p><p>This is why we had to run. </p><p>Why my flesh was torn open. </p><p>Why I'm here now. </p><p>It's why I'm alive and others are not. </p><p>I've lost everything that ever mattered to me. </p><p>But I'm going to get it back.</p>In his highly readable horror debut, Kidman employs several narrative tactics (including flashbacks, dreams and journal entries) to tell the moving story of Eddie Farris, a 20-something writer with an overactive imagination who killed his father, Michael, seven years earlier in self defense and is still suffering severe psychological consequences. Making matters worse is the fact that Eddie still lives in tiny Black Hills, Pa., where the town residents treat him like a freak. When Eddie's high school sweetheart returns, claiming to be stalked by a resurrected Michael, Eddie's life spirals even further out of control. The brutal murder act, referred to as "The Showdown" by Eddie, isn't actually depicted until the book's end. Instead, Kidman refers to the incident throughout? slowly foreshadowing and building tension as the reader becomes emotionally invested in the characters. Readers journey with Eddie through an adolescence made miserable by his abusive father, and they share in his blossoming romance and brutal breakup with his former girlfriend. Unfortunately, a contrived conclusion cheapens the plot and may leave readers feeling duped. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One and a half million children and teenagers were murdered by the Nazis. This photo-history, produced in association with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, focuses on what happened to young people whose world of family and friends, school and play, was destroyed. More than 30 short, accessible chapters cover the general history, including the rise of Hitler, the ghettos, the transports, the camps, the gas chambers, and the movements of resistance and rescue. Sidebars tell the ongoing stories of individual young people and show their ID photos; some of the individuals are pictured several times during the period 1933-45, but many don't survive. The writing is direct, with no histrionics or gimmicks. A wealth of material drawn from the museum's large collection of photographs and taped oral and video histories supports the facts. The systematic murder is confronted here. We're told of the brutality, the medical experiments, and the corpses stacked up like cordwood, and there are pictures of the death marches and the gas chambers. The Jews were the main target of Nazi hatred, but throughout the book, Bachrach also talks about other groups and individualsincluding Gypsies, homosexuals, and the disabledwho were marked as enemies of the state. The book's design is clear, with a spacious chronology at the back, a long bibliography, subdivided by genre and reading level, and an appendix of population figures by country. This is one of the best books available for introducing the subject to young people and an excellent text for the Holocaust curriculum now required in many states. <i>Hazel Rochman</i>Grade 5 Up-Intended to extend the experience of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum beyond its walls, this book reproduces some of its artifacts, photographs, maps, and taped oral and video histories. Many of them are from archival collections in the museums of Germany, the Netherlands, England, and Poland, as well as those in the United States. The book is divided into three sections: Germany before and during the Nazi regime; the final solution, including the ghettos; and rescue, resistance, and liberation. Bachrach makes the victims of Hitler's cruelty immediate to readers, showing that, like readers, they were individuals with hobbies and desires, friends and family. Two interesting devices are used to generate emotional involvement. The first is an attractive "cast of characters," guileless young people whose pictures, taken from their identity cards, smile innocently out from the page and in other photographs, enjoying life. The second is to insert these same identity cards and photos of life before Hitler into the narrative of destruction so that readers can trace what is happening to the young people at different points in the Holocaust until their death or the war's end. Thus, this is a very personal approach to Holocaust history and a very effective one.<br><i>Marcia Posner, Federation of New York and the Jewish Book Council, New York City</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Feeding the Ancestors: Tlingit Carved Horn Spoons (Peabody Museum Collections Series)</h2><p><p> <i>Feeding the Ancestors</i> presents an exquisite group of carved spoons from the Pacific Northwest that resides in the collections of Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Carved from the horns of mountain goats and Dall sheep, and incorporating elements of abalone shell and metal, most of the spoons were collected in Alaska in the late nineteenth century and were made and used by members of the Tlingit tribe. Hillel Burger's beautiful color photographs reveal every nuance of the carvers' extraordinary artistry. </p><p> </p><p> Anne-Marie Victor-Howe introduces the collectors and describes the means by which these and other ethnographic objects were acquired.
